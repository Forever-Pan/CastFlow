## Tool Results (called tools only; ordered: mandatory tools first, then optional tools)
### model_auxiliary_tool
- Description: Base prediction tool (FOUNDATION): Selects optimal forecasting models from historical similar cases and generates reference predictions. This provides the BASE forecast that should serve as the foundation for your final prediction. Use this as the primary reference point.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-17 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-18 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [24.52, 22.73, 21.14, 19.80, 19.28, 20.25, 23.06, 24.28, 27.20, 27.59, 27.76, 27.82, 27.17, 26.15, 24.78, 24.79, 25.71, 28.65, 33.58, 38.33, 40.08, 38.72, 35.92, 32.42]. This captures typical daily electricity price patterns: low overnight, rising in morning, peak evening, drop at night.

<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: High correlations with ""System load forecast"" (0.83) and ""Generation forecast"" (0.81). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment possible. Reference prediction likely already incorporates similar patterns.

**comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool**:
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shifts, use full history.
- slope_max=31.61, slope_second_diff_max=61.12: Recent momentum, but reference already models this.
- flatline_ratio=0.99 high, but with peak_count=6 and sample_entropy=0.59, signal has structure (daily cycles). No need for constant output.
- acf1=0.90, acf_s=0.54: Strong autocorrelation and seasonality, matched by reference's fluctuations.
- median=36.92, but recent values lower (~25-40); reference mean ~28.7 aligns with recent regime.

**data_quality_tool**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.01), no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

No major corrections required: reference_prediction is optimal base, maintains volatility/patterns (night low ~20, day ~25-28, evening peak ~38-40).
</tool_think>

Final prediction uses reference values directly (rounded to 2 decimals for consistency with input data).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-11 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-12 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [26.18, 23.47, 22.51, 22.29, 22.77, 25.07, 30.28, 36.25, 39.95, 41.13, 40.82, 39.27, 37.14, 35.76, 34.63, 34.78, 36.42, 39.67, 43.08, 44.80, 45.63, 42.85, 38.58, 33.53]. This captures typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak around 09:00-20:00, evening drop.

<tool_think>
Exogenous: Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.83) and ""System load forecast"" (0.73). No specific future values provided, so no direct adjustment, but expect alignment with typical load patterns (which the base already reflects).

Comprehensive features: High flatline_ratio (0.95) indicates many stable periods, but peak_count=10 shows diurnal cycles. acf1=0.90 and acf_s=0.63 confirm strong hourly/daily autocorrelation - base prediction preserves this. slope_max=22.29 and slope_second_diff_max=25.69 indicate momentum in rises/peaks, which base follows. No changepoints (score=0). Data quality good (low saturation/dropout).

Changepoint_trend: No regime shift. High flatline but not ""dead signal"" (hits low). Recent history shows typical weekend-like low demand on 2016-09-11 transitioning to weekday pattern - base extrapolates this well.

No major corrections needed: base already optimal for EPF-BE electricity prices (diurnal, weather/load driven).
</tool_think>

Final prediction uses base values directly (rounded to 2 decimals for price consistency, maintaining volatility/pattern).

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-03 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-04 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool**: Reference prediction shows typical daily electricity price pattern - low overnight (20-24), rising morning (~24-31), peak afternoon/evening (38+), drop evening. Matches historical intraday cycles (night low, day high, evening peak/drop).

**exogenous_analysis**: Strong positive correlations (Generation forecast: 0.73, System load forecast: 0.58). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment. Historical alignment suggests reference already incorporates similar effects.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 31.0, MAD 8.66 (moderate vol); high ACF1 (0.87) indicates strong autocorrelation/seasonality (matches reference fluctuations); low changepoint_score (0.0) - no regime shift, use full history; spec_entropy 0.38 (predictable signal); flatline_ratio 0.96 but peak_count 10 - structured flats + peaks, not dead signal; event_dominant_pattern 1.0 suggests upward macro bias, but reference shows cycle.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score 0); high slope_max (25.47) and slope_second_diff_max (27.13) indicate momentum/peaks - reference already boosts peaks appropriately; low monotone_duration (0.05), no mean reversion needed; high flatline_ratio but with peaks - maintain reference cycle.

**data_quality_tool**: Low issues (dropout 0, saturation 0.01, quantization 0.10) - data reliable, no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.
</tool_think>

**Final Decision**: Reference_prediction is optimal foundation. No major corrections needed: no changepoints, quality good, correlations implicitly captured, features align with cyclic pattern. Use reference values directly as they match volatility, peaks (~38), and daily cycle seen in history (e.g., recent days show similar night~24, peak~38, evening drop).

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-13 23:00:00"". Next 24 hours start from ""2016-09-14 00:00:00"".

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided):
[30.64, 26.26, 24.35, 23.03, 22.19, 25.21, 32.13, 43.10, 48.43, 53.92, 53.29, 53.84, 50.72, 49.33, 48.48, 48.86, 51.63, 52.25, 53.85, 53.71, 53.87, 48.63, 40.91, 33.91]
This captures typical diurnal pattern: night low ~22-30, morning rise, daytime peak ~50-54, evening drop.

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong correlations (Generation forecast: 0.80, System load: 0.68). No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor adjustment not needed. Base already incorporates similar historical cases.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis**:
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=31.61, slope_second_diff_max=61.12 (recent strong uptrend/acceleration, but base already shows continued daytime peak then evening drop - no boost needed).
- flatline_ratio=0.97 high? But peak_count=9, sample_entropy=0.58 indicates real diurnal signal, not dead. Base has proper volatility.
- No truncation or reversion; follow base pattern.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=35.33, mad=9.81 (base mean ~43, recent data had high peaks like 100, so base reasonable).
- acf1=0.90 high (persistent), acf_s=0.42 (seasonal) - base matches hourly/daily cycle.
- spec_entropy=0.61 (moderate noise) - conservative, stick to base.
- No quality issues (dropout=0, saturation low).

**Final Decision**: Base prediction is optimal - matches EPF-BE diurnal pattern (low night, peak afternoon/evening, drop late). No major corrections needed. Use reference values directly (minor rounding for floats).

**Tool Think Summary**:
- Foundation: reference_prediction (primary).
- No exogenous adjustment (no future values).
- No changepoint/trend correction (score=0, base captures momentum).
- Quality OK, predictability good.
</think>

<tool_think>
Base: reference_prediction used directly.
Exogenous: High correlations noted, but no future values for adjustment.
Changepoint: score=0, no truncation.
Trend: slope_max high but base follows pattern.
Quality: All low risk.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-07 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-08 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction [29.789272, 27.061547, ..., 32.962639] as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases, including daily cycle: low overnight, rising morning peak ~44-46, afternoon dip, evening peak ~45, then drop.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong correlations (Generation forecast: 0.84, System load: 0.73). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Maintain base pattern as it implicitly incorporates such dynamics.

**Comprehensive Features & Changepoint/Trend:**
- High flatline_ratio (0.95) but low flatline_hits (0.01), indicating some stability but not dead signal.
- No changepoints (score=0), so no memory truncation.
- slope_max=16.05 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=17.88: Recent acceleration supports morning rise in base prediction.
- High acf1=0.91, acf_s=0.51: Strong autocorrelation/seasonality, base prediction matches diurnal cycle.
- spec_entropy=0.42 (moderate noise), sample_entropy=0.77: Follow base fluctuations.
- median=33.97, mad=10.24: Base aligns (mean ~39, vol ~8).
- Data quality good (low saturation/dropout=0.01/0.0), no clipping needed.

**No major corrections needed:** Base prediction fits patterns (10 peaks, regular spacing cv=0.39). Recent history shows typical weekday cycle ending at 32.99, base continues logically into next day.

Final prediction uses reference_prediction directly (minor rounding for floats).
<tool_think>
All tools considered: base as foundation, exogenous supports cycle, no regime shifts/quality issues, trend momentum aligns with base rise.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-19 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-20 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [36.009768, 31.735351, 29.532237, 26.167022, 25.851171, 29.416133, 36.183005, 44.740738, 48.546047, 50.242925, 49.141583, 48.241028, 47.054022, 45.008086, 44.114285, 44.151353, 45.087606, 45.530419, 46.7015, 46.777123, 47.565098, 45.30989, 40.633449, 37.882063]. This captures typical daily electricity price patterns: low overnight, rising in morning, peak daytime, evening drop.

Exogenous correlations: High positive correlations with ""System load forecast"" (0.826) and ""Generation forecast"" (0.788). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment possible. Base prediction likely already incorporates similar historical exogenous patterns.

Comprehensive features:
- Median 37.67, close to base mean (~42, slightly higher but reasonable).
- High flatline_ratio (0.976) but low flatline_hits (0.012), indicating some stability but not dead signal.
- No changepoints (score 0.0), so no regime shift truncation needed.
- High slope_max (31.61) and slope_second_diff_max (61.12) suggest momentum, but base already models typical diurnal cycle.
- acf1 0.90 indicates strong persistence, matched by base's smooth transitions.
- Data quality good: low saturation (0.012), no dropouts/constants.

Changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints, moderate monotone_duration (0.048), not extreme. No need for reversion or flat output. Base prediction shows realistic fluctuations (volatility preserved).

Data_quality_tool: Minor saturation, no clipping needed.

Overall: Base prediction is reliable foundation. No major corrections required. Minor bias adjustment possible (shift down slightly toward median 37.67), but pattern/volatility must be preserved. Recent history shows weekend-like lower prices (Sep 17-18 low), rising Sep 19; base continues typical weekday pattern. Use base directly as it matches EPF-BE diurnal characteristics.

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction values assigned to sequential timestamps.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-05 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-06 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [26.60, 24.28, 23.94, 22.81, 23.75, 27.13, 33.41, 42.16, 47.17, 48.01, 47.27, 44.33, 40.15, 37.07, 35.81, 35.52, 38.11, 41.01, 43.77, 44.56, 44.15, 42.58, 37.96, 30.45]. This captures typical daily electricity price patterns: low overnight, rising morning peak, high daytime, evening peak, dropping night.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.76) and ""System load forecast"" (0.59). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment. Base prediction likely already incorporates similar historical exogenous patterns.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- High slope_max=25.47 and slope_second_diff_max=27.13: Strong momentum/acceleration in past peaks, but base prediction already models typical diurnal cycle with peaks.
- flatline_ratio=0.95 high but flatline_hits=0.012 low: Some flat periods but not dominant; signal has clear peaks (peak_count=10).
- No need for truncation, boosting, or reversion; base follows realistic cycle.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, quantization=0.15). No clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Other Features (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=30.35, mad=8.05: Base prediction aligns (mean ~37, but cycles around median with volatility).
- acf1=0.88 high: Strong autocorrelation, base prediction preserves hourly persistence.
- No major corrections needed per _llm_comprehensive_hints.

**Final Decision:** Base prediction is optimal foundation matching EPF-BE diurnal patterns (night low ~20-25, morning rise, day peak ~45-48, evening ~40-45, night drop). Minor rounding for float precision, no significant deviations to maintain volatility/patterns.

**Tool Think Summary:** Reference is strong; no exogenous values for adjustment; no changepoint/quality issues requiring correction. Prediction closely tracks reference.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-15 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-16 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [33.863999, 30.38444, 27.604235, 26.882216, 27.089571, 29.733206, 35.298227, 42.432981, 47.291465, 50.429611, 50.346036, 49.249724, 47.475288, 46.684305, 43.388893, 42.75817, 44.941242, 47.051304, 47.568884, 48.393241, 47.86952, 44.926924, 42.149073, 37.403688]. This captures typical daily electricity price pattern: low overnight, peak daytime, evening drop.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
<tool_think>
Strong positive correlations: Generation forecast (0.83), System load forecast (0.79). These typically follow similar diurnal patterns (low night, high day), supporting the base prediction's shape without specific exogenous values provided for forecast window. No major adjustment needed.
</tool_think>

**Statistical Analysis (basic_statistics_tool):**
<tool_think>
Median=38.38 (base pred mean ~42, slightly high - minor downward bias correction possible but pattern dominates). MAD=11.92 (moderate vol, matches base). High ACF1=0.90 (strong persistence, base ok). ACF_s=0.59 (seasonal, base diurnal ok). Spec_entropy=0.58 (moderate noise, conservative ok). No major periodicity injection needed as base has fluctuations.
</tool_think>

**Trend & Regime (changepoint_trend_tool):**
<tool_think>
No changepoints (score=0). High slope_max=31.61 & slope_2diff_max=61.12 indicate sharp ramps (e.g., morning peaks) - base already captures via model selection from similar cases. Flatline_ratio=0.98 high but with peak_count=8, it's diurnal flat nights + peaks. No truncation/boost/reversion needed. Maintain base pattern.
</tool_think>

**Comprehensive (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
<tool_think>
Confirms above: event_segment_count=8 (diurnal cycles), quality ok. No regime shifts/drift. Use median for level check (slight bias), momentum supports base ramps.
</tool_think>

**Final Decision:** Base prediction excellent match for EPF-BE diurnal pattern. Minor bias correction: shift down by ~1-2 (median 38 vs base ~42 mean), but preserve exact volatility/fluctuations. No exogenous values for precise adjust. Prediction closely follows reference with tiny smoothing for realism.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
The last historical timestamp is ""2016-09-23 23:00:00"". The next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-24 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY foundation (38.16, 33.61, ..., 35.10). This captures optimal patterns from similar cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.88) and ""System load forecast"" (0.85). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Maintain base pattern assuming similar exogenous drivers.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- Median: 41.0 (base mean ~36.3, slightly low → minor upward bias correction possible).
- MAD: 7.59 (moderate volatility, matches base).
- ACF1: 0.89, ACF_s: 0.65 (strong daily seasonality, base likely incorporates).
- Flatline_ratio: 0.94 (high, but peak_count=10 indicates real diurnal cycles; not dead signal).
- Slope_max: 14.61, slope_second_diff_max: 28.12 (momentum present, no reversal signal).
- Changepoint_score: 0 (no regime shift).
- Quality: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.01).

**Changepoint/Trend**: No changepoints. High flatline but with peaks; momentum suggests maintaining diurnal pattern. No truncation/boost needed.

**Data Quality**: Clean data, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Final Strategy**: Base prediction closely matches historical diurnal pattern (night low ~25-30, day peak ~45-50). Minor upward shift (~+1-2) for median bias, but preserve exact volatility/fluctuations. No major deviations.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-27 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-28 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a typical diurnal electricity price pattern: low overnight (35.3 → 26.0), morning ramp-up (to 46.8), daytime plateau around 41-46, evening peak (47.0), then decline to 37.4. This matches historical patterns in the data (e.g., lows ~25-30 early morning, peaks ~45-50 daytime/evening).

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.90) and ""System load forecast"" (0.83). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Expect prices to follow typical load/generation diurnal cycles, which the reference_prediction already captures well.

**Comprehensive Features & Changepoint/Trend Tool:**
- High flatline_ratio (0.94) but low flatline_hits (0.012), indicating some stability but not dead signal.
- No changepoints (score=0), so no memory truncation needed.
- slope_max=13.29 and slope_second_diff_max=14.73 indicate momentum/acceleration in recent trends, but since we're in a typical cycle post-peak hours (last data 38.72 declining), reference_prediction appropriately continues the evening-to-morning decline then ramp-up.
- High acf1 (0.91) and moderate acf_s (0.40) confirm strong daily seasonality, matched by reference.
- Low spec_entropy (0.29) suggests predictable signal; no need for conservative smoothing.
- peak_count=8 over 168h (~weekly), regular spacing; reference follows expected next cycle.
- No quality issues (low saturation/dropout=0.012/0.0).

**Data Quality:** Minor saturation (0.012), no clipping needed. All reliable.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation, already incorporating similar historical cases and diurnal patterns. No major corrections needed (no regime shifts, drifts, or quality flags). Minor refinements for precision: slight upward bias correction (residual_mean ~0, but historical median=41.37 vs reference mean ~40.5, shift up by ~0.1-0.2 where appropriate), but impact negligible. Maintain exact volatility/fluctuations. Use reference values directly as they perfectly align with EPF-BE characteristics.

**Tool Think Summary:** Base ref pred adopted with no exogenous values for adjustment. Features confirm stable, seasonal, predictable signal matching ref pattern.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [40.671373, 36.843215, ..., 40.567512]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases, so final prediction must closely follow this pattern (daily cycle: low overnight, peak daytime ~50, evening decline).

Exogenous analysis: Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.91) and ""System load forecast"" (0.81). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Expect typical demand-driven cycle matching reference.

Comprehensive features:
- High flatline_ratio (0.95) but low flatline_hits (0.018), minor data artifacts, not invalidating signal.
- High acf1 (0.905) indicates strong persistence, sample_entropy (0.97) shows fluctuations.
- No changepoints (score=0), so use full history.
- slope_max (15), slope_second_diff_max (16.3) suggest momentum, but reference already incorporates.
- Data quality good: low saturation (0.018), no dropouts/constants.

Changepoint_trend_tool: No regime shifts, high flatline_ratio but not dead signal. Momentum present but reference handles it.

Data_quality_tool: Minor saturation, no clipping needed (historical range ~15-55, reference within).

No major corrections needed: reference_prediction is optimal base. Minor bias check - historical median 41.37, reference mean ~43.5 (slightly higher), but pattern matches recent levels (~40-50). No shift applied. Volatility (MAD~6.9) matches reference fluctuations.

Final prediction uses reference values directly, as they best capture EPF-BE electricity price diurnal cycle.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-25 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are 2016-09-26 00:00:00 to 2016-09-26 23:00:00.

**Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool**: Use the reference_prediction [35.301173, 30.686464, ..., 41.390845] as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases, including typical diurnal electricity price cycles (night low, morning rise, daytime peak, evening decline).

**Exogenous analysis**: Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.89) and ""System load forecast"" (0.83). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Expect prices to follow typical load/generation patterns aligned with reference (higher daytime, lower night).

**Comprehensive features & changepoint_trend**:
- No changepoints (score=0), so no regime truncation needed.
- High flatline_ratio (0.93) but low flatline_hits (0.01), indicating some stability but not dead signal—reference already smooth.
- slope_max=14.56 (positive momentum), slope_second_diff_max=23.96—no deceleration signal, so no reversal adjustment.
- High acf1=0.905 (strong persistence), peak_count=8 (regular daily cycles)—reference matches this.
- median=41.01, mad=6.51—reference averages ~41, volatility matches.
- No quality issues (low saturation/dropout).

**Tool think summary**: No major corrections needed. Reference is solid foundation. Minor bias check: recent data (Sep 25) shows weekend-like low prices (~20-48), transitioning to weekday pattern in reference (night ~25-35, day ~41-48). No exogenous values for adjustment. Maintain reference volatility/pattern—no flattening or monotonic changes.

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction directly as it best captures EPF-BE electricity price dynamics.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-05 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-06 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION: [28.006006, 26.446172, 21.87269, 21.413009, 21.641497, 25.827919, 33.949287, 43.77884, 47.227768, 47.755683, 44.996563, 41.006338, 37.993837, 36.423328, 35.090311, 34.63851, 37.308819, 41.191219, 46.815568, 50.490683, 49.778807, 46.754598, 42.990314, 37.713884]. This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak, afternoon dip, evening peak.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong correlations (Generation forecast: 0.862, System load: 0.696). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment. Rely on base.

**tool_think (Comprehensive Feature Tool):**
- Median 40.03, reference mean ~38.5 (close, no major bias correction).
- MAD 9.715 indicates moderate volatility - matches reference fluctuations.
- High ACF1 (0.83) and ACF_s (0.49): strong autocorrelation/seasonality - reference already captures this.
- Spec_entropy 0.36 (moderate predictability).
- No changepoints (score 0), so full history valid.
- Slope_max 27.17, slope_second_diff_max 37.69: momentum captured in reference daily cycle.
- Flatline_ratio 0.98 but hits low (0.018): minor flats, not dead signal.
- Peak_count 11: reference maintains ~2 peaks/day pattern.
- Data quality good (low dropout/saturation).

**tool_think (Changepoint/Trend Tool):** No regime shift (changepoint 0). Momentum/peaks handled in reference. No truncation/boost/reversion needed.

**tool_think (Data Quality):** All ratios low - no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation matching EPF-BE diurnal patterns (night low ~20-30, day ~40-50, peaks ~50). No significant corrections needed. Use as-is for pattern/volatility fidelity.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-01 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-02 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a clear daily cycle: low overnight (24.76→18.63), morning rise (19.89→26.51), midday dip (24.94→21.04), afternoon low (20.96), evening peak (22.86→43.43), late evening decline (42.36→37.14). This matches historical EPF-BE patterns (night low, evening peak). My prediction MUST closely follow this pattern and volatility.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.91) and ""System load forecast"" (0.80). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment. Rely on base which likely incorporates these.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=16.81, slope_second_diff_max=17.15: Recent momentum captured in reference (evening peak).
- flatline_ratio=0.96 high but flatline_hits=0.018 low: Minor flats, not dead signal.
- peak_count=9, sample_entropy=0.99: Cyclical with noise, reference handles this.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference aligns.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, constant=0). Reliable data, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=42.7, mad=6.28. Reference mean ~29.5 (calculated), lower than median due to recent downtrend to 27.67. acf1=0.88 high autocorrelation, acf_s=0.40 seasonal: Reference preserves this. No bias correction needed as reference from similar cases.

**Final Strategy:** Use reference_prediction directly as it captures optimal pattern from similar historical cases, aligns with strong diurnal cycle in data (night ~20-40, evening peaks ~45-55), and no tool flags require adjustment. Minor smoothing for float precision but maintain exact volatility/fluctuations.

<tool_think>
All tools analyzed: Base is solid foundation. Exogenous supports but no values. No changepoints/quality issues. High flatline_ratio noted but low hits, cyclical pattern dominant.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-09 23:00:00"". Next 24 hours start from ""2016-09-10 00:00:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [29.61, 26.69, 24.78, ..., 29.70]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases, so final prediction must closely follow this pattern (typical daily cycle: low overnight, peak evening).

Exogenous correlations: Strong positive with ""Generation forecast"" (0.84) and ""System load forecast"" (0.73). No specific future values provided, so no direct adjustment possible. Assume base model already incorporates typical exogenous patterns.

Comprehensive features:
- Median 33.52, high flatline_ratio (0.96) but low flatline_hits (0.01), indicating some stability but with peaks (peak_count=10).
- High acf1 (0.92), seasonal acf_s (0.55), low spec_entropy (0.41) → predictable cyclical pattern.
- slope_max=16.05 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=17.88 → recent acceleration, but no changepoints (score=0), so no truncation.
- Data quality good (low saturation/dropout), no clipping needed.
- No regime shift or quality issues requiring major deviation.

No corrections needed: base prediction aligns with strong autocorrelation, daily cycle, and momentum. Maintain its volatility and fluctuations (not monotonic).

Final prediction uses reference values directly (minor rounding for floats).

<tool_think>
Used model_auxiliary_tool as foundation (no deviation).
Exogenous: High correlations but no future values → no adjustment.
Changepoint_trend: No changepoints, positive slopes → follow base momentum.
Data quality: Clean → no clipping/uncertainty expansion.
Comprehensive: Cyclical, predictable → base prediction optimal.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-03 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-04 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided: starts ~39.7, peaks ~57.75 around evening, declines to ~44.25). This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases - MUST follow closely.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlations (Generation forecast: 0.872, System load forecast: 0.791). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment possible. Rely on base which likely incorporates these.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- Median 42.72, high flatline_ratio (0.97) but peak_count=9 indicates daily peaks.
- High acf1 (0.86) shows strong hourly autocorrelation, acf_s (0.47) seasonal.
- No changepoints (score=0), so no regime truncation.
- slope_max=21.34 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=37.69 → slight boost possible for morning ramp-up, but base already shows this (43→52→55).
- Low spec_entropy (0.30) → predictable signal, conservative adjustments.
- Data quality good (low dropout/saturation), no clipping needed.

**Changepoint/Trend**: No changepoints, high flatline_ratio but with peaks → base's fluctuation pattern fits (not constant). Momentum supports base's morning rise.

**Data Quality**: All ratios low → reliable, no uncertainty expansion/clipping.

**Overall Strategy**:
- Foundation: reference_prediction (closely matches typical electricity pattern: night low → morning peak → day stable → evening peak → night decline).
- Minor refinements: Slight upward bias (median 42.72 vs base avg ~47) but base fits historical peaks (e.g., recent 73). Momentum boost minor (+0.2 avg to align volatility).
- Maintain volatility/fluctuations: Base has ~10-15 pt swings → preserve.
- No major deviations: Final closely tracks base with tiny momentum nudge.

Refined prediction: Use base values directly (optimal given no exogenous series, no issues flagged).

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Base used as-is (pattern/volatility match).
- exogenous_analysis: Correlations noted, no adjustment data.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: No changepoints, momentum aligns with base rise.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No truncation/boost needed beyond base.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp from input: ""2016-10-07 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-08 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool (PRIMARY FOUNDATION):**
Reference prediction: [45.43, 39.58, 34.89, 32.58, 32.05, 35.39, 43.04, 49.93, 52.42, 54.09, 53.42, 49.35, 46.70, 41.64, 39.54, 38.75, 39.29, 41.99, 47.73, 51.14, 51.89, 49.07, 44.97, 40.32]
This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak ~54, afternoon dip, evening peak ~52, then decline. This must be the core pattern - my prediction will closely follow it.

**Tool analysis for refinements:**

<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis:** Strong positive correlations (Gen forecast 0.81, System load 0.72). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment possible. Reference prediction likely already incorporates similar patterns.

**comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool:**
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shifts, use full history.
- slope_max=28.78, slope_second_diff_max=44.03: Recent strong upward momentum (matches recent data rise to 53.93), supports boosting morning/evening peaks as in reference.
- flatline_ratio=0.98 high but flatline_hits=0.024 low: Minor flat periods, not dominant - ignore dead signal warning.
- peak_count=13, peak_spacing_cv=0.40: Regular daily peaks, reference captures this well.
- No need for truncation, reversion, or reversal - follow reference momentum.

**data_quality_tool:**
- Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.024 low, quantization=0.089): Data reliable, no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Summary:** No major corrections needed. Reference prediction aligns with strong autocorrelation (acf1=0.86), daily seasonality (acf_s=0.48), and recent uptrend. Minor bias check: series median=40.35, reference avg ~44.3 (slightly high but consistent with recent values ~50-77). No shift applied. Volatility (mad=11.22) matches reference fluctuations.
</tool_think>

**Final decision:** Use reference prediction directly as it captures optimal pattern from similar cases, refined by tool insights (momentum support, no quality issues). Round to 2 decimals for consistency with input data.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp from input data: ""2016-10-09 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-10 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: use these 24 values as the core pattern, which capture historical similar cases, daily cycle (night low ~28-35, morning rise to ~55-58 peak around 08:00-09:00, daytime ~47-56, evening peak ~60 around 19:00, then decline).

<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.77) and ""System load forecast"" (0.69). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Expect electricity prices to follow typical load/generation patterns (higher daytime/evening), which aligns with reference_prediction's peaks.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**:
- High ACF1 (0.85) and ACF_s (0.48): Strong serial/seasonal dependence → reference_prediction likely captures this well.
- Median 44.07, MAD 9.55: Reference mean ~47 aligns reasonably (slight upward bias ok for weekend-to-weekday transition).
- High flatline_ratio (0.95): Some flat periods, but peak_count=12 shows diurnal cycles → maintain reference fluctuations.
- slope_max=28.78, slope_second_diff_max=44.03: Recent momentum, but no changepoints → no truncation/boost needed.
- spec_entropy=0.42 (moderate noise), sample_entropy=0.76: Use reference's volatility, no smoothing.
- Data quality ok (low dropout/saturation).

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0), moderate monotone_duration → no regime shift or reversion correction. High flatline but reference has proper variation → follow reference.

**data_quality_tool**: All ratios low → no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

Overall: No major corrections required. Reference_prediction matches EPF-BE diurnal pattern (low night, peaks morning/evening). Minor upward shift (+0.5 avg) for recent weekend-to-Sunday transition (Oct 9 Sunday → Oct 10 Monday expectation of slight demand rise), but stay very close to reference volatility/pattern.
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Use reference values directly (they fit perfectly), rounded to 2 decimals for price realism.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp from input: ""2016-10-11 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-12 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool (PRIMARY FOUNDATION): Use the 24 reference values as the core forecast, as they capture optimal patterns from similar historical cases. Values show typical daily electricity price pattern: high overnight/morning peak, gradual decline through day, evening peak, then decline.

Exogenous correlations (KEY REFINEMENT): Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.89) and ""System load forecast"" (0.80). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no numerical adjustments. Assume base prediction already incorporates typical exogenous patterns.

Comprehensive features:
- Median 47.8, high flatline_ratio (0.95) but low flatline_hits (0.018), indicating some stability but 11 peaks.
- High acf1 (0.88) shows strong autocorrelation; spec_entropy 0.50 moderate predictability.
- slope_max 32.16 and slope_second_diff_max 52.29 indicate momentum/acceleration possible, but changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift), so no truncation.
- No quality issues (low dropout/saturation).

Changepoint_trend: No changepoints, moderate monotone_duration, so stick to base pattern without reversion/boost.

Data quality: Minor saturation (0.018), no clipping needed.

Overall: Base prediction aligns with historical volatility/patterns (morning peak ~80s, daytime ~70s decline, evening peak ~87, night decline). No major corrections needed - use reference directly as it matches EPF-BE daily cycle.

Final prediction: Exact reference values assigned to timestamps.
<tool_think>
Used model_auxiliary_tool as foundation (no deviation).
Exogenous: Strong generation/load corr, but no window values → no adjustment.
Features: No changepoints, good quality → no corrections.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-19 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-20 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (55.84, 48.35, ..., 62.57). This captures optimal patterns from similar cases. Final prediction must closely follow its shape, volatility, and diurnal cycle (night low ~40s, morning rise to ~80s peak, evening decline).

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlations (Generation forecast: 0.83, System load: 0.68). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment. Qualitatively supports typical daily load/price cycle matching reference.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=81.86 (strong uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=153.09: Recent acceleration supports morning peak boost in reference (~73-86 range).
- flatline_ratio=0.994 high but flatline_hits=0.024 low: Minor flat periods, not dead signal.
- peak_count=11, peak_spacing_cv=0.375: Regular daily peaks, reference timing appropriate.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference already incorporates.

**Data Quality** (data_quality_tool): All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.024, constant=0). Reliable data, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=56.7, mad=14.1: Reference mean ~66 aligns reasonably (slight high bias possible, but volatility matches).
- acf1=0.82 high (persistent), acf_s=0.38 (seasonal): Reference shows expected hourly persistence + daily cycle.
- spec_entropy=0.61 moderate: Good predictability, conservative adjustments only.
- No major corrections per _llm_hints.

**Final Decision**: Reference_prediction is optimal foundation. Minor refinements: Slight downward shift (~1-2 units) for median alignment, but preserve exact pattern/volatility (no mono-trend, maintain fluctuations). No other tool flags require changes.

<tool_think>
All tools used: model_auxiliary_tool (base), exogenous_analysis (no adjustment), comprehensive_feature_tool/data_quality_tool/changepoint_trend_tool (no flags triggered).

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
The last historical timestamp is ""2016-10-15 23:00:00"". The next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-16 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour each.

**Base Analysis:**
- Reference prediction from model_auxiliary_tool provides the primary foundation: a realistic diurnal pattern typical for electricity prices (night low ~26-40, morning rise, daytime ~30-42, evening peak ~48-57).
- Pattern: Starts moderate (40.4), dips to ~26-27 mid-morning, rises gradually to ~42 midday, dips afternoon ~30-32, evening rise to peak ~57-58 around 20:00, then decline to ~47.

**Tool Integration:**
<tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool:** Use reference_prediction as core baseline - it captures historical similar cases with correct volatility and diurnal cycle.

**exogenous_analysis:** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.834) and ""System load forecast"" (0.699). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment possible. Assume reference_prediction implicitly incorporates these via similar cases.

**comprehensive_feature_tool:** 
- Median 56.4, reference mean ~41.5 (slightly lower, minor downward bias correction possible but small).
- High flatline_ratio (0.976) but low flatline_hits (0.042), acf1 0.827 (strong persistence), spec_entropy 0.633 (moderate noise).
- No regime shift (changepoint_score=0), but high slope_max (81.86) and slope_second_diff_max (153) indicate momentum/peaks present.
- Guidance: Use median/mad for baseline (mad=16.6 aligns with reference volatility ~10-15 range), predictability moderate.

**changepoint_trend_tool:** No changepoints (score=0), so full history valid. High slope metrics suggest momentum captured in reference (evening uptrend aligns). Low monotone_duration (0.05), moderate peak_spacing_cv (0.34) - no reversion/regularity forcing needed. flatline_ratio high but not ""dead signal"" level.

**data_quality_tool:** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.042 minor, quantization=0.155). No clipping/uncertainty expansion needed; predictions reliable within historical bounds (min~27, max~58 here fits data range ~28-194).
</tool_think>

**Final Adjustments:**
- Stick closely to reference_prediction pattern/volatility (critical).
- Minor refinements: Slight upward shift (~+1-2) early hours for median alignment (56.4 vs ref avg), but preserve dips/peaks.
- No major corrections: No changepoints, quality good, exogenous unspecified.
- Ensure 24-hour diurnal cycle: low night/morning, peak evening, as in ref and historical (e.g., Oct 15 low daytime ~30-50).

**Prediction:** Refined reference with minimal smoothing for natural flow.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp from input: ""2016-10-17 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are 2016-10-18 00:00:00 to 2016-10-18 23:00:00.

**Base Foundation (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use reference_prediction as primary baseline: [50.65831, 41.720048, 38.517257, 36.432191, 36.810429, 45.013203, 60.08649, 80.465671, 85.095822, 83.467879, 81.166181, 77.929071, 73.144357, 69.831209, 67.977595, 65.647843, 64.973221, 69.154832, 76.092956, 82.761614, 78.47739, 69.894824, 63.618345, 60.063634]. This captures typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak ~85, afternoon decline, evening rise ~82, late decline.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.83) and ""System load forecast"" (0.69). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Assume reference_prediction already incorporates similar historical exogenous patterns.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=81.86 (strong uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=153.09: Recent acceleration supports morning peak boost, but reference already has realistic peak ~85.
- flatline_ratio=1.0 but flatline_hits low (0.02): Minor flat periods, not dead signal.
- peak_count=10, sample_entropy=0.87: Regular daily cycles with noise, matches reference fluctuations.
- No truncation/boost needed; reference aligns.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.02, quantization=0.15): Reliable data, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=56.7, mad=15.06, acf1=0.82 (strong autocorrelation), spec_entropy=0.62 (moderate predictability). Reference mean ~65 aligns with recent levels; volatility matches mad.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation matching EPF-BE daily cycle (night low ~35-50, day peak ~80-85, evening ~70-80). Minor smoothing for stability given high acf1, but preserve fluctuations. No major deviations.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-13 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-14 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [44.90, 40.49, 37.34, 36.45, 37.49, 44.37, 57.41, 69.95, 71.80, 72.20, 70.51, 66.83, 61.07, 58.14, 56.30, 54.03, 54.83, 57.61, 63.90, 68.99, 66.09, 60.59, 55.39, 50.64]. This captures typical daily patterns: low overnight, morning rise, daytime peak, evening decline.

Exogenous correlations: High positive correlation with ""Generation forecast"" (0.90) and ""System load forecast"" (0.81). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment possible. Rely on base which likely incorporates these patterns from similar cases.

Comprehensive features:
- Median 53.78, close to base mean (~57), no major bias correction needed.
- High flatline_ratio (0.96) but peak_count=11 indicates structured daily cycles, not dead signal.
- High acf1 (0.88) and acf_s (0.51) confirm strong daily seasonality, matched by base.
- slope_max=32.16 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=52.29 (acceleration), but changepoint_score=0.0 so no regime shift; base already handles typical morning boost.
- spec_entropy=0.43 (moderate predictability), sample_entropy=0.98 (some noise), supports using base pattern.
- Data quality good: low dropout/saturation.

Changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints, high flatline but with peaks; momentum suggests maintaining base's rise-fall pattern, no truncation/boost needed beyond base.

Data_quality_tool: Minor saturation (0.036), no clipping required.

Overall: Base prediction aligns well with patterns (night low ~37-44, morning rise to ~72 daytime, evening drop). No significant corrections needed; use reference directly with minor rounding for float consistency.

<tool_think>
Used model_auxiliary_tool as foundation (no deviation).
Exogenous: High correlations noted but no window values for adjustment.
Comprehensive/changepoint/data_quality: No regime shifts, good quality, momentum matches base daily cycle - no corrections applied.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [62.2423, 53.373067, 48.188769, 45.610967, 43.801017, 49.373948, 58.284683, 71.444387, 76.053195, 75.151057, 72.457522, 66.814742, 64.001212, 57.190922, 53.486098, 52.504967, 53.169366, 56.790194, 66.829794, 72.772862, 71.500101, 64.983301, 59.742435, 57.067728]. This captures temporal patterns, volatility, and diurnal cycle from similar cases. Final prediction will closely follow this pattern (typical night low -> morning rise -> daytime peak -> evening drop).

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** High correlations (Generation forecast: 0.90, System load forecast: 0.83). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Maintain base pattern as it likely incorporates these influences.

**Comprehensive Diagnosis (comprehensive_feature_tool):** 
- Median 61.38, MAD 15.83: Baseline level/scale normal; reference aligns (mean ~62).
- ACF1 0.85, ACF_s 0.52: Strong serial/seasonal dependence; reference preserves this.
- High flatline_ratio 0.99 but low flatline_hits 0.03: Some quantization but not dead signal.
- Slope_max 82.36, slope_second_diff_max 134.85: Recent strong uptrend/momentum (e.g., Oct 21 peak at 167); reference shows continued morning rise (h6-h9: 58→76), no need for extra boost.
- Changepoint_score 0.0: No regime shift; use full history.
- Spec_entropy 0.64, sample_entropy 0.75: Moderate noise; conservative adherence to reference.
- Quality: Low saturation 0.03, no dropout; no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.
- Events: 8 segments, dominant up (pattern 0.0); reference maintains realistic cycle.

**Changepoint/Trend (changepoint_trend_tool):** Confirms no changepoints (score 0), high momentum (slope_max 82+), regular peaks (spacing CV 0.35). Reference already compensates (morning boost, evening peak at h19 ~73); no truncation/boost/reversal needed.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (saturation 0.03, no constant/dropout); data reliable, no adjustments.

**Overall Strategy:** Reference is optimal foundation (pattern/scale match diagnostics). Recent history shows diurnal cycle (night ~40-70, morning rise to 70-140+, evening peaks 80-160+). No major corrections needed: use reference directly to preserve volatility/fluctuations (e.g., h0-5 drop, h6-10 rise, h18-20 peak, h21-23 drop). Last historical timestamp: ""2016-10-21 23:00:00"".
</tool_think>

**Final Decision:** Adopt reference_prediction unchanged as it aligns with all diagnostics, maintains realistic EPF-BE diurnal pattern, and incorporates similar-case learning. Timestamps: 2016-10-22 00:00 to 2016-10-22 23:00.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-25 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-26 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided):
[56.26, 46.16, 38.64, 35.21, 34.40, 48.61, 71.60, 138.40, 149.72, 159.20, 154.63, 148.50, 139.61, 134.89, 124.45, 106.00, 87.70, 97.03, 125.46, 153.52, 128.06, 93.37, 79.58, 69.88] (rounded for readability).

This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, morning rise, daytime peak around 09:00-11:00, evening peak around 19:00, then decline. Matches historical electricity price behavior (e.g., peaks at 07-10 and 18-20).

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong positive correlations (Generation forecast: 0.73, System load: 0.64). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment. Reference_prediction likely already incorporates similar historical exogenous patterns.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool and comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0.0, changepoint_count=0.0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=213.44, slope_second_diff_max=312.44: Recent strong upward momentum (matches Oct 25 peaks up to 299). Reference_prediction captures this with morning peak ~159 and evening ~153.
- flatline_ratio=0.98 high, but peak_count=9 and recent volatility high: Not dead signal; intermittent flats common in data, but prediction shows proper fluctuations.
- No need for truncation/boost/reversion; reference already aligns with momentum.

**Data Quality**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.05 low, no clipping needed. quality_quantization_score=0.18 moderate, but no major issues.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=69.25, mad=20.32: Reference mean ~100, but captures volatility.
- acf1=0.80 high autocorrelation: Reference maintains continuity.
- No major corrections needed per _llm_comprehensive_hints.

**Final Decision**: Reference_prediction is optimal foundation, matches historical patterns (night low ~35-50, morning ramp to 140-160, daytime dip, evening peak ~150, night decline). Minor rounding to 2 decimals for consistency with input data. No significant deviations required.

<tool_think>
All tools considered: Base used directly (strong pattern match), exogenous (no window data), changepoint (no shift), quality (clean).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-23 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-24 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided):
[43.79, 39.50, 34.88, 34.26, 34.50, 39.97, 53.03, 76.80, 77.86, 77.08, 74.12, 70.41, 68.23, 64.44, 61.36, 59.10, 58.58, 60.79, 71.23, 83.27, 74.84, 66.22, 60.26, 58.20]
This captures typical diurnal electricity price pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak, daytime levels, evening peak, then decline.

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong correlations (Generation forecast: 0.90, System load forecast: 0.79) suggest load/renewables drive prices. No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor adjustment not needed. Base already incorporates similar historical cases.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0.0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=82.36 (high), slope_second_diff_max=134.85: Recent momentum captured in base.
- flatline_ratio=0.98 (very high), flatline_hits=0.02: Recent data has flats (e.g., 37.1 repeats on 10-22), but base prediction shows realistic fluctuations - follow it to avoid over-flattening.
- peak_count=10, sample_entropy=0.83: Maintain diurnal peaks as in base.
No major corrections: no truncation, no strong boost/reversion needed.

**Quality**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.02 low), no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Hints**: Median=64.08, base mean ~62 aligns well (no bias shift). acf1=0.82 high autocorrelation preserved in base pattern. spec_entropy=0.57 moderate - base is appropriate.

**Final Decision**: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches EPF-BE diurnal patterns, volatility, and tool diagnostics. No significant deviations needed.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp in the input data: ""2016-10-27 23:00:00"". The next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-28 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as the PRIMARY foundation: [51.60, 46.81, 40.81, 36.05, 40.43, 47.44, 58.86, 79.22, 87.80, 86.48, 85.79, 83.01, 74.86, 71.28, 66.54, 62.69, 64.65, 66.61, 78.66, 88.34, 84.37, 71.62, 64.80, 59.94]. This captures typical diurnal patterns: low overnight, rising morning peak, evening peak, then decline.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.70) and ""System load forecast"" (0.64). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment. Assume base prediction already incorporates similar historical exogenous patterns.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift; use full history.
- High slope_max=213.44 and slope_second_diff_max=312.44: Indicates sharp past peaks (e.g., Oct 25 morning spike), but current recent trend (last day) is stable diurnal without acceleration.
- flatline_ratio=0.96 (very high): Suggests many flat periods historically, but recent data shows normal fluctuations; no ""dead signal"".
- peak_count=8: Expect continued diurnal peaks.
- No need for truncation, boosting, or strong reversion; base prediction already matches typical cycle.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.05 low, quantization=0.19 moderate). No clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Features:** Median=62.82 aligns with base prediction average (~68); acf1=0.80 high autocorrelation supports smooth diurnal continuation; spec_entropy=1.23 moderate noise, so conservative adherence to base.

**Final Decision:** Base prediction is optimal foundation matching EPF-BE diurnal patterns (night low ~40-50, morning peak ~80-90, evening ~80-90). Minor smoothing for flatline_ratio but retain fluctuations. No major deviations.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-29 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-30 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):**
Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 24 values provided):
[40.437111, 35.32887, 30.741401, 31.714527, 30.908885, 33.687202, 36.614842, 44.476013, 49.84072, 48.817122, 52.410392, 54.014646, 47.697854, 49.156722, 46.401188, 44.133771, 48.186546, 49.073456, 64.449857, 74.046748, 65.675488, 59.512035, 57.729444, 53.357632]

This shows typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning, peak evening, drop night. Volatility matches historical electricity prices. This is the core pattern to follow.

**Exogenous Analysis:**
Strong positive correlations: Generation forecast (0.65), System load forecast (0.60). No specific future exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Qualitatively supports diurnal load-based pattern in reference_prediction (no change needed).

**Comprehensive Features & Changepoint/Trend Analysis:**
- High flatline_ratio (0.96), flatline_hits (0.048), quality_saturation_ratio (0.048): Minor data quality issues (possible clipping/saturation), but quality_dropout_ratio=0, constant_channel=0. Suggests slight clipping risk - clip predictions conservatively if extreme, but reference is within historical bounds (min~30, max~300; reference max 74).
- High slope_max (213.44), slope_second_diff_max (312.44): Past sharp momentum/peaks (e.g., Oct 25 spikes), but changepoint_score=0, no current regime shift.
- peak_count=6, acf1=0.81 (strong hourly autocorr), event_dominant_pattern=1.0: Supports continuing strong diurnal cycle as in reference.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed (low changepoint_score, monotone_duration low).
- qkurt=5.57 (fat tails), residual_exceed_ratio=0.054: Aware of outlier risk, but reference already calibrated from similar cases.

**Data Quality Gate:**
Minor saturation (4.8%), no major issues. No clipping or uncertainty expansion required.

**Final Decision:**
- No significant corrections needed. Reference_prediction perfectly captures diurnal pattern matching historical behavior (night low ~30-40, day rise to ~50s, evening peak ~70s, night drop).
- Minor quality saturation suggests staying conservative - reference already does (no extremes).
- Output reference values directly (floats as-is) paired with timestamps.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-21 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-22 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [35.979209, 31.841315, 27.737104, 26.43787, 26.08823, 28.663787, 35.148334, 42.363059, 47.511744, 49.386458, 48.148329, 47.39426, 45.902852, 44.660105, 44.057809, 43.433759, 44.759066, 46.606105, 47.783331, 48.264809, 47.684679, 45.272337, 41.818859, 39.257162]. This captures typical diurnal pattern: night low ~26-28, morning rise, daytime peak ~48-49, evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** High correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.857) and ""System load forecast"" (0.842). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment. Electricity prices typically follow load/generation patterns, which align with the diurnal shape in reference_prediction.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=14.61 (positive momentum), slope_second_diff_max=28.12: Recent uptrend acceleration, but reference already incorporates.
- flatline_ratio=0.958 high, but flatline_hits=0.012 low, peak_count=10: Some flat periods but clear diurnal cycles; no dead signal.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference handles momentum.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, constant=0): High quality, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Other Features (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=39.15, mad=8.15: Reference mean ~42 aligns reasonably (slight high bias, but no major shift).
- acf1=0.89, acf_s=0.57: Strong autocorrelation/seasonality; reference shows proper diurnal fluctuations.
- spec_entropy=0.34 (low=structured), sample_entropy=0.87: Predictable signal, trust reference.
- No major corrections needed per _llm_hints.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation with correct pattern/volatility matching historical diurnal cycles (low night, peak daytime ~17-20h, evening drop). Minor refinements unnecessary given tool signals. Use reference values directly (rounded to 2 decimals for price consistency).

<tool_think>
All tools analyzed: base ref strong, high exo corr but no values, no changepoints, good quality, strong seasonality → no adjustments.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-31 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-01 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [33.99, 34.10, 33.66, 32.04, 33.04, 36.86, 45.10, 54.68, 57.03, 58.53, 57.75, 53.00, 50.48, 50.68, 48.99, 45.23, 47.88, 52.16, 64.21, 63.38, 56.86, 49.96, 44.47, 42.47]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Final prediction must closely follow this pattern (low overnight, morning rise, daytime peak around evening, evening decline).

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.62) and ""System load forecast"" (0.58). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Expect morning/daytime increases aligned with typical load/generation patterns, which reference_prediction already reflects.

**tool_think (Comprehensive Feature Tool):**
- Median 56.20, but recent data shows downward regime ~35-65 (lower than historical median).
- High flatline_ratio (0.95) indicates many flat periods, but recent data has peaks/valleys - prediction should maintain reference fluctuations, not go constant.
- High acf1 (0.83) shows strong autocorrelation - reference_prediction preserves this serial dependence.
- High qkurt (5.89) indicates fat tails/heavy volatility - reference has peaks (e.g., 64.21), which fits.
- slope_max (213.44) and slope_second_diff_max (312.44) show past sharp ramps, but changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift), so no truncation/boost needed.
- No quality issues (low dropout/saturation).

**tool_think (Changepoint Trend Tool):** No changepoints (score=0), so use full history. High flatline_ratio but recent volatility present - follow reference pattern. Low monotone_duration, moderate peak_count (6) - expect similar daily cycle in reference.

**tool_think (Data Quality Tool):** Minor saturation (0.06), quantization ok - no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Final Reasoning:** Reference_prediction is optimal baseline matching similar cases. Recent trend downward to ~38-65, continuing low overnight then daily cycle. No major corrections needed (no changepoints, quality ok). Minor bias correction: recent mean ~45, reference mean ~48 - slight downward shift (~2-3 units) for conservatism given flatline hints and lower recent levels, but preserve exact pattern/volatility. Use reference values directly as they fit electricity price diurnal cycle (low night, peak evening).

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp from input data: ""2016-11-04 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are hourly increments starting from ""2016-11-05 00:00:00"".

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided). Mean ~55.3, shows realistic daily pattern: low overnight, peak evening ~71, decline to ~49. Matches electricity price diurnal cycle seen in history (peaks 17:00-20:00).

**Exogenous refinement**: Strong correlations (Generation forecast 0.82, System load 0.73). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment. History shows load/price alignment, supporting base pattern.

**Changepoint & trend analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=68, slope_second_diff_max=115: Recent strong uptrends/acceleration (e.g., Nov 2-4 peaks), but current end at 53.29 post-peak decline. No boost needed; base already captures momentum.
- flatline_ratio=0.96 high, but peak_count=10, sample_entropy=0.68: Structured flats + volatility, not dead signal.
- monotone_duration low: No mean reversion forced.
- No truncation/boost/reversal adjustments; base prediction aligns.

**Quality & stats** (data_quality_tool, comprehensive):
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.042 low, no clipping.
- quality_quantization=0.17 moderate, minor uncertainty but no expansion needed.
- median=48.36, mad=10.6: Base mean ~55 slightly higher (recent uptrend), reasonable.
- acf1=0.81 high autocorrelation, acf_s=0.61 seasonal: Base preserves this.
- No bias/residual corrections (residual_mean~0).

**Final decision**: Base prediction is optimal - captures pattern, volatility, diurnal cycle matching history (e.g., recent peaks 100-150, evening highs). Minor smoothing not needed; preserve fluctuations. No significant deviations.

**Tool think summary**: Reference is foundation. No exogenous values for adjustment. No changepoint/trend corrections triggered. Data quality good. Output base as-is.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-02 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-03 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a realistic daily cycle: low overnight (47→38), morning rise (45→64), daytime plateau around 50-60, evening peak (71→72), then decline (65→51). This matches typical electricity price patterns (night low, day high, evening peak). My prediction MUST closely follow this pattern and volatility.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.85) and ""System load forecast"" (0.75). These likely drive the morning rise and evening peak in reference_prediction. No specific future exogenous values provided, so no numerical adjustment needed. Pattern already incorporates these effects from similar cases.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=50.65, slope_second_diff_max=66.71: Recent strong upward momentum (matches recent data spike to 108.79), but reference_prediction shows realistic mean reversion - no need to boost further.
- flatline_ratio=0.95 high: Some flat periods, but peak_count=11 and sample_entropy=0.83 indicate structured cycles, not dead signal.
- No truncation or major correction needed; reference_prediction handles momentum.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.02, constant=0). Reliable data, no clipping or uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features:** acf1=0.83 (strong hourly autocorrelation), median=47.74 (matches reference mean ~54), mad=9.7 (volatility aligned). No bias correction needed. spec_entropy=0.38 (structured signal), supports following reference fluctuations.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal baseline from similar cases. Minor smoothing for flatline_ratio (slight reduction in extremes), but maintain pattern/volatility. No exogenous values for adjustment. Output closely tracks reference.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-06 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-07 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction [36.534136, 33.120751, ..., 42.731049] as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Final prediction must closely follow this pattern: starts low ~36, dips to ~32-34, rises to ~37-45 morning, peaks daytime ~45-71 evening, then declines ~65→54→49→44→42.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.79) and ""System load forecast"" (0.63). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Rely on base which likely incorporates these.

**Comprehensive Features & Changepoint/Trend:**
- High flatline_ratio (0.96) and flatline_hits (0.03): Data has many flat periods, but recent history shows volatility (peaks 155,134). Reference already accounts for this.
- slope_max=68, slope_second_diff_max=115: Recent strong uptrends and accelerations (e.g., evening peaks), but no changepoints (score=0). No truncation needed.
- peak_count=7, consistent with daily cycle. Reference follows diurnal pattern (low night, peak evening).
- acf1=0.81 high autocorrelation, acf_s=0.52 seasonal: Reference preserves this.
- No quality issues: low dropout/saturation, no clipping needed.
- median=45, mad=9: Reference aligns (mean ~47, volatility matches).

**Tool Think Summary:** No major corrections needed. Reference_prediction is optimal base. Minor bias check: recent values (Nov 5-6) lower volatility post-peaks vs earlier spikes, but reference appropriately moderates (peak 71 vs historical 155). No regime shift, momentum continuation via reference pattern. Maintain volatility/fluctuations as in reference.

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction directly (floats as-is).

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-10 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-11 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [46.53, 31.63, 35.31, 36.35, 38.87, 51.80, 67.05, 76.97, 80.26, 86.13, 82.23, 76.83, 67.64, 67.85, 70.16, 72.11, 79.57, 99.25, 112.51, 94.61, 80.73, 69.13, 50.17, 52.12]. This captures typical daily electricity price patterns: low overnight, rising morning peak, daytime plateau, evening peak, then decline.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.62) and ""System load forecast"" (0.51). No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor refinement only. Expect morning rise (hours 6-9) and evening peak (hours 18-19) to align with typical load/generation patterns, which reference already reflects.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** quality_saturation_ratio=0.10 (moderate, due to past spikes like 678.31), so clip extreme predictions if needed—but reference stays within historical bounds (median=58.64, mad=19.76). No dropout or constant issues.

**Changepoint/Trend (changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive):** No changepoints (score=0). High slope_max=555.85 and slope_second_diff_max=897.39 from past spikes, but current regime stable. flatline_ratio=0.96 high (many flat periods), but 5 peaks indicate diurnal cycle. sample_entropy=0.27 low (predictable). No truncation/mean reversion needed; follow reference cycle.

**Comprehensive Features:** acf_s=0.56 (seasonal strength), peak_count=5 (diurnal). Reference matches this pattern. No major bias (residual_mean~0). Use reference as-is with tiny smoothing for stability given flatline_ratio.

Final prediction: Use reference values directly (rounded to 2 decimals for price format consistency), as it best matches EPF-BE diurnal volatility and tool diagnostics. No significant deviations needed.

All tools considered: base dominant, exogenous supports peaks, quality ok, no regime shifts.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-08 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-09 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [78.96, 65.96, 56.98, 60.60, 61.16, 73.77, 81.76, 91.78, 88.46, 84.28, 83.24, 81.65, 70.66, 77.19, 67.75, 76.07, 88.16, 126.70, 268.50, 168.84, 111.60, 76.47, 68.61, 58.01]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases - must follow closely.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.63) and ""System load forecast"" (0.51). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Note positive correlations suggest demand/generation influences peaks.

**tool_think (Comprehensive Feature Tool):**
- Median 54.88, MAD 16.90: Baseline around 55, moderate volatility - reference pred aligns (mean ~92, but captures spikes).
- High flatline_ratio (0.96), flatline_hits (0.125): Much flat periods, but recent data shows spikes (e.g., 579, 678) - reference pred correctly anticipates post-spike decline then evening peak.
- High slope_max (556), slope_second_diff_max (897): Recent extreme momentum from spikes - reference already boosts evening peak (~268 at t=19).
- Low changepoint_score (0), peak_count (5): No regime shift, consistent daily peak pattern around 18:00.
- Low sample_entropy (0.27): Predictable low-entropy signal - trust reference patterns.
- No major quality issues (dropout=0).

**tool_think (Changepoint Trend Tool):** No changepoint (score=0), so no memory truncation. High slopes confirm recent uptrend momentum into evening peak - boost confirmed in reference (peaks at 268). Flatline_ratio high but recent activity overrides - no dead signal. Low peak_spacing_cv suggests regular daily peaks - reference timing good.

**tool_think (Data Quality Tool):** saturation_ratio=0.125 (minor clipping from spikes), quantization=0.51 - clip if needed but reference within historical bounds (max 678). No dropout - reliable.

**Final Reasoning:** Reference_prediction is optimal baseline matching daily electricity patterns: night decline, morning rise, evening peak. Minor bias correction: recent post-spike (66.18) vs ref start (79) - slight downward adjustment early, but preserve volatility. No exogenous values for precise shift. Maintain fluctuations (no monotone). Output closely follows reference with tiny refinements for recency (reduce early hours by ~2-3% toward 66).

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-12 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-13 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [48.57, 44.68, 43.62, 44.06, 41.20, 46.58, 48.19, 44.63, 50.08, 54.77, 52.80, 48.36, 48.18, 51.51, 44.20, 42.36, 50.64, 61.45, 75.45, 72.71, 59.60, 56.50, 48.84, 51.18]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases - shows typical daily cycle: low overnight, rising morning, peak evening, decline night.

Exogenous correlations: ""Generation forecast"" (0.62), ""System load forecast"" (0.49). No specific future values provided, so minor refinement only if needed; base already incorporates similar patterns.

Comprehensive features: median 61.38 (base avg ~52, slightly low - minor upward bias possible but not drastic), mad 17.6 (moderate vol), high flatline_ratio 0.98 but with peak_count 4 and slope_max 556/slope_second_diff 897 indicating sharp events (likely the saturation spikes seen historically at 18:00). residual_exceed_ratio 0.012 low. quality_saturation_ratio 0.077 - minor clipping risk, but predictions below historical extremes (~600), no clip needed. No changepoints (score 0), so use full history. Hints: check median/mad (vol ok), momentum high (base has evening peak rise to 75, aligns).

Changepoint_trend: No regime shift, high momentum/acceleration supports base's peak build-up. flatline_ratio high but with peaks - expect continuation of cycle, not dead signal.

Data quality: Minor saturation, no dropout/constant issues - predictions reliable.

Overall: Base prediction fits well - typical weekday pattern post-weekend stabilization. Recent data (Nov 12) shows evening peak 94.57 dropping to 55.81, base starts reasonable ~48-51 overnight transitioning to daytime rise. No major corrections needed; maintain base pattern/volatility (no mono trend, has fluctuations/peak). Round to 2 decimals for consistency with input.

Final prediction uses base values closely.
<tool_think>
- Used model_auxiliary_tool as foundation (primary).
- Incorporated exogenous correlations directionally (load/gen drive peaks, base has them).
- Comprehensive/changepoint/data_quality: No truncation/boost/reversion/clip needed; high momentum supports evening rise in base.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-16 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-17 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 24 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Tool analysis**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Moderate positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.58) and ""System load forecast"" (0.48). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Expect typical diurnal pattern (low night, peak evening) consistent with reference.

**comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool**:
- High slope_max (558) and slope_second_diff_max (1105) indicate sharp momentum/peaks in history (e.g., 696 spike).
- flatline_ratio=0.96 high → mostly stable periods, but 4 peaks detected.
- changepoint_score=0 → no regime shift, use full history.
- No need for truncation/boost/reversion; reference already handles.
- peak_spacing_cv=0.90 suggests irregular peaks; reference shows expected evening peak around h17-18.

**data_quality_tool**:
- saturation_ratio=0.083 → minor clipping risk (historical spikes), but clip not needed as reference stays reasonable (~30-96).
- No dropout/constant issues.

Overall: Data has diurnal cycles with evening peaks and volatility; reference matches this perfectly (low overnight ~30-40, rise morning, peak ~96 at h18, evening drop).
</tool_think>

**Final prediction strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it aligns with EPF-BE diurnal patterns, tool diagnostics, and historical volatility. Minor smoothing not needed; preserves fluctuations (e.g., early low, mid-day dip, evening peak).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-22 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-23 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (38.51, 35.41, ..., 43.50). This captures optimal patterns from similar cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong correlations with ""System load forecast"" (0.806) and ""Generation forecast"" (0.757). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment possible. Rely on base.

**Basic Statistics**:
- Median: 48.7 (base pred mean ~53.8, slightly higher; minor positive bias possible but pattern dominates).
- MAD: 11.27 (moderate volatility, matches base fluctuations).
- ACF1: 0.86 (strong persistence), ACF_s: 0.55 (seasonality), spec_entropy: 0.43 (predictable). Base already incorporates.
- No major bias correction needed (small median shift insufficient to override pattern).

**Changepoint/Trend**:
- changepoint_score: 0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max: 30.14 (recent momentum, but base captures).
- flatline_ratio: 0.95 (high flat periods historically, but base shows realistic daily cycle: night low → morning rise → evening peak → night drop).
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed.

**Comprehensive**: Confirms stable regime, moderate entropy. No data quality issues. Follow base pattern.

**Final Strategy**: Base prediction shows classic electricity profile (low night, peak ~18-19h). No significant corrections warranted. Use reference values directly (minor rounding for floats).

**Timestamps**:

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-20 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-21 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation:
[38.01, 36.87, 39.32, 36.93, 35.60, 34.56, 52.49, 57.00, 62.49, 63.68, 62.09, 57.40, 52.38, 53.70, 51.80, 52.43, 55.57, 68.27, 82.48, 65.14, 48.51, 46.36, 41.11, 38.63]
This shows typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak around hour 18 (82.48), evening drop. Maintain this exact pattern/volatility.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
- Strong correlations: Generation forecast (0.54), System load forecast (0.51).
- No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no numerical adjustments. Directionally supports load-following pattern in reference (morning rise, evening peak), which aligns with historical electricity prices.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=558.02, slope_second_diff_max=1105.44 (past high momentum from outlier like 696.02 spike, but recent data post-11/19 is low ~13-55, stabilizing).
- flatline_ratio=0.958 (high flat periods recently), peak_count=4 (few peaks), sample_entropy=0.39 (low complexity).
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference already captures post-spike mean reversion to ~40-60 range.
- Hints: No high changepoint, no dead signal (flatline_hits low), maintain reference momentum.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):**
- saturation_ratio=0.018 (minor, from past spike), no clipping needed (reference within historical bounds 13-55 recent).
- No dropout/constant issues.

**Comprehensive Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=51.37, mad=13.92 (reference mean~53, std~12 aligns well, no bias correction).
- acf1=0.40 (moderate persistence), spec_entropy=2.50 (some noise), qkurt=3.99 (mild fat tails) → reference's fluctuations appropriate, no smoothing/injection needed.
- event_segment_count=6, no dominant pattern forcing deviation.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal baseline matching historical diurnal cycle, recent low levels (~44.9 last), and tool diagnostics. No significant adjustments required. Use rounded to 2 decimals for consistency with input data.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-18 23:00:00"". Next 24 hours start from ""2016-11-19 00:00:00"".

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided):
[41.55, 37.33, 35.26, 31.35, 33.96, 38.73, 48.57, 43.15, 46.31, 50.17, 47.22, 48.85, 48.59, 45.18, 39.55, 38.78, 46.35, 54.63, 65.27, 60.70, 48.11, 46.80, 38.66, 42.65]

This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning, peak evening, drop night. Matches electricity price seasonality (low night, high evening).

**Exogenous refinement**: Correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.50) and ""System load forecast"" (0.48). No specific future values provided, so minor adjustment not applied. Base already incorporates similar patterns.

**Changepoint & trend analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=558.02, slope_second_diff_max=1105.44 (past high momentum from outlier peak at 2016-11-14 18:00, but recent data stable).
- flatline_ratio=0.95 (high flat periods recently, but reference_prediction has fluctuations - preserve them).
- peak_count=4, sample_entropy=0.42 (moderate predictability, follow reference volatility).
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference captures post-outlier normalization.

**Data quality** (data_quality_tool): saturation_ratio=0.07 (minor, one outlier), no clipping/dropouts. Predictions within historical bounds (30-70 typical, past outlier ignored).

**Comprehensive stats**: median=58.86, mad=13.15 (reference mean ~46 aligns with recent downtrend post-peak). acf_s=0.33 (moderate seasonality, reference has it). No bias correction needed.

**Final decision**: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches patterns, volatility, and tool diagnostics. No major corrections; minor rounding for floats.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-24 23:00:00"". Next 24 hours start from ""2016-11-25 00:00:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [40.200812, 36.192258, 34.750446, 33.323919, 33.773286, 37.44627, 45.701345, 53.971118, 57.713998, 58.592961, 57.757645, 58.054756, 55.206499, 56.342264, 54.029772, 56.714181, 59.828236, 62.986514, 64.58798, 62.610387, 57.576958, 52.111062, 48.863799, 45.292851]. This captures typical daily electricity price patterns: low overnight, rising morning, peak afternoon/evening, declining night.

<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Strong correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.88) and ""System load forecast"" (0.83). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment possible. Rely on base which likely incorporates these patterns.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 48.43 (base pred avg ~50.8, close), MAD 9.855 (moderate vol), high ACF1 0.86 (persistent), ACF_s 0.62 (seasonal), low spec_entropy 0.37 (predictable), no changepoints, high flatline_ratio 0.95 but low hits 0.012 (some stability but volatile peaks), slope_max 30.14 and second_diff_max 56.55 indicate momentum but no regime shift. No major bias correction needed; base aligns well.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: Confirms no changepoints (score 0), high slopes indicate past momentum but short monotone_duration 0.06 (no extreme), moderate peak spacing CV 0.33 (fairly regular). No truncation/boost/reversion needed; follow base pattern.

**data_quality_tool**: Low issues (dropout 0, saturation 0.012, quantization 0.107). No clipping or uncertainty expansion required.
</tool_think>

Historical recent trend (Nov 24): nighttime low ~30s, morning rise to 50s, peaks ~60s evening. Base prediction matches this cycle perfectly. High flatline_ratio noted but data shows clear diurnal pattern with peaks (e.g., 86.35 on 21st). No corrections alter the base significantly - it already has appropriate volatility, morning rise, evening peak ~65, and decline.

Final prediction uses reference_prediction directly as it best captures the expected pattern.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-14 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-15 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION: [82.96, 66.80, 64.40, 67.86, 56.85, 66.98, 81.83, 102.08, 104.61, 114.74, 119.73, 115.70, 106.71, 110.62, 105.18, 98.96, 110.46, 149.42, 275.60, 159.71, 105.63, 80.78, 67.69, 63.54]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases - daily cycle with morning rise, peak around evening (notably high at hour 18), and evening drop.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.62) and ""System load forecast"" (0.50). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no numerical adjustments. Expect load/generation-driven peaks in morning (06-10) and evening (17-19), which aligns with reference pattern.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shifts, use full history.
- slope_max=558.02, slope_second_diff_max=1105.44: History has sharp ramps (e.g., evening spikes to 579/696), but recent end at 57.62 is low post-spike. Reference already incorporates similar dynamics.
- flatline_ratio=0.95, flatline_hits=0.10: High flat periods historically, but recent volatility (spikes) suggests no ""dead signal"" - maintain reference fluctuations.
- peak_count=5, sample_entropy=0.37: Low entropy (predictable), regular peaks - reference has appropriate peak timing (high at 18th point).
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference handles momentum.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** quality_saturation_ratio=0.10 (minor clipping risk from historical spikes), quality_quantization_score=0.47 (moderate). Clip if needed, but reference peak (275) is below historical max (696), so no clipping.

**Comprehensive Features (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=62.7 (reference mean ~106, higher due to cycle peaks - expected), mad=17.2 (reference volatility matches), acf1=0.40 (persistence captured), spec_entropy=2.35 (some noise - conservative adherence to reference). event_dominant_pattern=1.0 (upward bias - reference shows cycle rise/fall). No major bias corrections needed.

**Final Strategy:** Closely follow reference_prediction pattern/volatility (morning rise 82→119, afternoon dip 106-98, evening peak 149→275→159 drop). Minor rounding for float precision. No significant deviations.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-28 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-29 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a typical daily electricity price pattern: low overnight (42.27 → 37.99 → 37.16 → 34.62 → 35.12), morning rise (39.82 → 50.82 → 63.94), daytime peak around evening (68.04 → 67.20 → 66.04 → ... → 71.39), then evening drop (68.84 → 63.47 → 57.20 → 53.21 → 47.30). This matches historical intraday patterns in the data (low night, peak afternoon/evening, drop evening).

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.91) and ""System load forecast"" (0.86). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. However, typical load follows similar diurnal pattern (higher daytime), supporting the base prediction's shape without major shifts.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=20.45, slope_second_diff_max=29.84: Recent momentum present, but base prediction already incorporates via similar cases.
- flatline_ratio=0.98 high, but flatline_hits low (0.012), quality issues minor (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, quantization=0.089): Minor clipping risk, but no need to flatten or mark invalid. Data reliable enough.
- peak_count=7, regular spacing (peak_spacing_cv=0.028 low): Supports diurnal cycle in base prediction.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; base captures momentum.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low, no uncertainty amplification or clipping required.

**Comprehensive Features:** Median=50.04, mad=11.16 (base prediction mean ~57, std ~10 - aligned). acf1=0.90 high (persistent), spec_entropy=0.32 low (predictable signal). sample_entropy=1.01 moderate. No bias correction needed. Hints confirm: use median/mad for baseline (matches), no structural breaks, predictable signal.

**Final Decision:** Base prediction is optimal foundation with correct pattern/volatility matching history (e.g., recent days show similar peaks ~65-76, drops to ~30-40). No significant corrections needed from tools. Use reference values directly (minor rounding preserved).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-26 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are 2016-11-27 00:00:00 to 2016-11-27 23:00:00.

**Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool**: Use the reference_prediction [36.104252, 32.04524, ..., 40.36279] as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases. Maintain its volatility, daily cycle (night low ~30s, morning rise, daytime peak ~50s, evening decline), and fluctuations.

**Tool analysis**:

<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: High correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.90) and ""System load forecast"" (0.85). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment possible. Reference_prediction likely already incorporates these patterns.

**comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool**:
- No changepoints (score=0, count=0): No regime shift, use full history.
- High flatline_ratio (0.96): Indicates many flat periods (typical for electricity prices with stable daytime levels), but 7 peaks and sample_entropy=0.89 show structure. Reference_prediction already handles this with appropriate plateaus/flats.
- slope_max=30.14, slope_second_diff_max=56.55: Recent momentum captured in reference.
- acf1=0.87, acf_s=0.67: Strong autocorrelation and seasonality; reference follows this.
- median=48.53, mad=10.42: Reference aligns (mean ~42, but recent data shifted lower; no major bias correction needed).
- No quality issues (dropout=0, saturation low).

No major corrections needed: flatline_ratio high but not ""dead signal"" (peaks present, entropy moderate). No truncation/boost/reversion indicated. Data quality good.
</tool_think>

**Final strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches historical patterns (night lows, peak evening/day, flats). Minor smoothing if needed for continuity from last value (42.7), but reference starts reasonably at 36.1 (typical night drop). No exogenous values for adjustment. Maintain exact pattern/volatility.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-02 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-03 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [48.44, 39.53, 36.40, 34.77, 36.31, 43.84, 51.01, 57.47, 64.15, 67.86, 64.73, 60.78, 55.34, 51.30, 50.45, 51.84, 55.29, 70.37, 81.57, 73.46, 65.90, 59.61, 53.08, 50.12]. This captures typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak, evening peak, then decline.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.72) and ""System load forecast"" (0.64). No specific future exogenous values provided, so no direct adjustment. Assume base prediction incorporates these patterns from similar cases.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=245.84 (high uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=481.01: Recent strong upward accelerations (e.g., price spikes to 360+). Base prediction shows rising trend to evening peak, consistent - no need for extra boost.
- flatline_ratio=0.96 high, but flatline_hits=0.024 low: Some saturation (quality_saturation_ratio=0.024), but data reliable (dropout=0). Clip if needed, but base stays within historical bounds (~30-360).
- peak_count=6, regular spacing: Base prediction matches typical intra-day peaks.
- No mean reversion needed (monotone_duration low).

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** Minor saturation (0.024), quantization (0.244) - predictions reasonable, no clipping required as base aligns with historical volatility (MAD=18.26).

**Comprehensive Features:** High ACF1=0.71 (persistent), acf_s=0.63 (seasonal), qkurt=4.82 (fat tails from spikes). Base prediction preserves volatility/pattern - no injection needed. Median=60.95 close to base mean (~56).

**Final Decision:** Use reference_prediction directly (rounded to 2 decimals for consistency with input). It matches electricity price diurnal cycle, recent spike context, and tool diagnostics. No significant corrections needed.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-04 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-05 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided):
[39.31, 34.37, 33.75, 33.21, 36.87, 42.56, 53.44, 68.28, 72.88, 76.34, 68.97, 61.95, 57.59, 59.77, 57.92, 57.06, 64.81, 73.30, 92.72, 73.93, 63.17, 56.88, 49.11, 45.53]

This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases - shows typical daily cycle: low overnight, rising morning peak, daytime highs, evening peak around hour 18 (92.72), then decline.

**Exogenous refinement**: Strong correlations (Generation forecast: 0.72, System load: 0.60). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment. Base already incorporates similar historical patterns.

**Changepoint & trend analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=245.84 (high), slope_second_diff_max=481.01: Recent strong momentum/peaks (matches historical spikes), but base prediction already captures diurnal peaks.
- flatline_ratio=0.96 high, but recent data shows volatility (peaks), so not ""dead signal"".
- peak_count=6, sample_entropy=0.52: Confirms cyclical pattern matching base.
No major corrections needed (no truncation/boost/reversion).

**Data quality** (data_quality_tool): Minor saturation (0.018), no dropout/constant issues. No clipping needed.

**Comprehensive stats**: median=63.5, mad=17.1 (base mean ~58, close enough, no strong bias correction). acf1=0.69 high (persistent), matches base's smooth cycle. No injections/expansions.

**Final decision**: Base prediction is optimal foundation. Minor smoothing for realism (electricity prices rarely jump sharply), but preserve volatility/pattern (morning rise, peaks at ~08-10 & 18h, evening drop). No exogenous values/adjustments applied. Output exactly these values (rounded to 2 decimals for price realism).

<tool_think>
All tools used: model_auxiliary_tool (base), exogenous_analysis (no adjustment), comprehensive_feature_tool/changepoint_trend_tool (no regime/momentum corrections), data_quality_tool (clean).

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-10 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-11 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 24 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases. Mean ~37.2, shows typical daily cycle: low overnight, rising morning peak ~38-47 evening, declining night.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong correlations (Generation forecast: 0.87, System load: 0.77). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment possible. Rely on base which likely incorporates these patterns.

**Comprehensive Features & Changepoint/Trend:**
- High flatline_ratio (0.89): Indicates many flat periods (e.g., Dec 8), but recent data more dynamic. No truncation needed.
- changepoint_score=0: No regime shift; use full history.
- slope_max=20.8, slope_second_diff_max=26.3: Recent momentum, but base already captures.
- acf1=0.89 (strong persistence), peak_count=10: Base prediction maintains realistic diurnal cycle with peaks.
- median=50.39 (higher than base mean ~37), but recent values lower (~40s); no strong bias correction needed as base tuned to similar cases.
- Data quality good (low dropout/saturation).

**Overall Strategy:** Closely follow reference_prediction pattern/volatility (lows ~30, peaks ~47). Minor upward shift (+1-2) for median alignment and recent weekend/Saturday context (Dec 11 likely similar to prior days: moderate peaks). No major deviations - maintain fluctuations (not monotone). No quality issues requiring clipping/expansion.

Final predictions: reference + small refinement for level/momentum.
</think>

<tool_think>
Used model_auxiliary_tool as base. Exogenous correlations noted but no window values. Comprehensive/changepoint/data_quality confirm good signal, no truncation/boost/clip needed. High flatline historical but recent dynamic; base cycle appropriate.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-14 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-15 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlations with ""System load forecast"" (0.806) and ""Generation forecast"" (0.802). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Maintain base pattern which likely incorporates these dynamics.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- High flatline_ratio (0.917) indicates many flat periods, but recent data shows volatility with daily peaks ~17-18h.
- High acf1 (0.906) shows strong autocorrelation - base prediction preserves this.
- slope_max (23.02) and slope_second_diff_max (34.17) indicate momentum, but no changepoints (score=0), so no truncation needed.
- peak_count=8 over 168h (~daily peaks), base prediction shows expected morning rise, evening peak, night decline.
- spec_entropy (0.36) moderate - signal predictable, trust base.
- Data quality good (low saturation/dropout), no clipping needed.

**Changepoint/Trend**: No regime shift (changepoint=0). Recent uptrend in day-prices, base prediction continues realistic diurnal cycle: night low ~43-50, morning rise to ~74, afternoon ~68-72, evening peak ~77, evening decline to ~54. No need for boost/reversion as pattern matches history.

**Final Decision**: Base prediction already optimal - follows historical volatility, diurnal pattern (lows 40s night, peaks 70s evening), no major corrections needed. Use directly (minor rounding for float consistency).

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation - use reference_prediction directly.
- exogenous_analysis: High correlations noted, but no window values - no adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High flatline_ratio but recent dynamic; acf1 high - preserve autocorrelation in base.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints, momentum in base pattern - no correction.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data - no uncertainty expansion/clipping.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-06 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-07 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):**
Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided):
[54.26, 50.87, 47.93, 47.97, 47.21, 50.86, 61.70, 72.02, 76.86, 78.37, 72.61, 62.51, 58.96, 58.97, 56.75, 60.63, 66.09, 78.02, 82.06, 74.78, 66.26, 58.03, 56.49, 55.55]
This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak ~78, evening peak ~82, then decline. Volatility matches historical electricity prices. Final prediction MUST closely follow this pattern.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
Strong positive correlations: Generation forecast (0.66), System load forecast (0.58). No specific future exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Qualitatively supports morning/evening peaks in reference (load/generation driven).

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- High flatline_ratio=0.94: Data has many flat periods (e.g., price caps at 80/200), but recent values vary (62.1 last). Reference already smooths this.
- slope_max=245.84, slope_second_diff_max=481.01: Past sharp ramps (e.g., morning spikes), but no current uptrend to boost.
- peak_count=6, peak_spacing_cv=0.21 (fairly regular): Reference captures expected peaks at ~08-10h and ~18h.
- No momentum correction needed; reference handles dynamics.
- monotone_duration low, no mean reversion trigger.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):**
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.054 (low, some clipping like 180/200/360 peaks), quality_quantization=0.26: Minor issues, no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed. Clip to historical bounds implicitly via reference (max ~82 < past peaks).

**Comprehensive Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=65.0, mad=16.9: Reference mean ~63.5 aligns well with median (no bias shift).
- acf1=0.70 high (persistent), acf_s=0.54 seasonal: Reference preserves autocorrelation/seasonality.
- spec_entropy=1.26 moderate noise: Conservative adherence to reference appropriate.
- qkurt=5.09 fat tails: Reference volatility matches historical spikes/dips.
- No major corrections; hints confirm baseline assessment.

**Final Decision:**
No significant corrections needed. Use reference_prediction directly (minor rounding to 2 decimals for price convention). Maintains volatility, peaks (morning ~78, evening ~82), diurnal cycle matching history and correlations. No flatline/dead signal override.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-12 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-13 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (48.03, 45.71, ..., 51.98). This captures optimal patterns from similar cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.84) and ""System load forecast"" (0.79). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Maintain base pattern which likely incorporates these dynamics.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool and comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0.0, changepoint_count=0.0: No regime shifts, use full history.
- slope_max=23.02 (significant uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=34.17: Recent acceleration supports base prediction's morning rise (48→59→69→73).
- flatline_ratio=0.90 (high, many flat periods historically), but flatline_hits=0.012 (low recent), peak_count=9: Expect continued daily cycle with peaks, not constant.
- monotone_duration=0.06 (low): No extreme mean reversion needed.
- No truncation or major overrides; base prediction aligns with momentum.

**Data Quality** (data_quality_tool): All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, quantization=0.10). No clipping, uncertainty expansion, or invalidation needed.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=49.96, mad=11.33: Base prediction centers around ~66 initially, reasonable given recent uptrend from ~35-49 to 68-95 peaks.
- acf1=0.90, acf_s=0.37: Strong autocorrelation and seasonality; base follows hourly/daily cycle.
- spec_entropy=0.33 (moderate predictability), sample_entropy=0.96: Base's fluctuations appropriate, no need for smoothing.
- No bias/residual corrections (residual_mean≈0).

**Final Strategy**: Adopt reference_prediction closely as it matches volatility, daily cycle (night low → morning rise → daytime peak → evening drop), and recent momentum. Minor rounding for float precision, no significant deviations.

**Tool Summary in <tool_think>**:
<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Base = reference_prediction (use as-is).
- exogenous_analysis: High correlations but no window values → no adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Median/mad baseline OK; high ACF → keep cyclic pattern; moderate entropy → follow base fluctuations.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints; high slope_max → validate base uptrend; high flatline_ratio historical but base has variation → OK.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data → no corrections.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
<tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool (PRIMARY FOUNDATION):**
- reference_prediction provides the base forecast with 24 hourly values starting from expected next timestamp.
- Pattern: Starts ~48, dips to ~42 mid-morning, peaks ~55 evening, then declines to ~42 overnight.
- Volatility: Moderate fluctuations (range ~42-55), typical diurnal cycle for electricity prices.
- MUST use as primary foundation - final prediction will closely follow this pattern.

**exogenous_analysis (KEY REFINEMENT):**
- Strong positive correlations: Generation forecast (0.89), System load forecast (0.85).
- No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so cannot apply quantitative adjustments.
- Qualitative: Expect prices to track generation/load patterns, but base model likely already incorporates this.

**comprehensive_feature_tool (FULL ANALYSIS):**
- median=55.9, mad=13.75: Historical level ~56, volatility moderate.
- acf1=0.92, acf_s=0.67: Strong hourly and seasonal autocorrelation → diurnal pattern expected (matches ref pred).
- spec_entropy=0.34 (low): Predictable signal, conservative adjustments.
- cusum_max=862, slope_max=23, slope_second_diff_max=34: Recent momentum/uptrends, but changepoint_score=0 → no regime shift.
- flatline_ratio=0.95, flatline_hits=0.01: Some flat periods but not dominant; ref pred has good fluctuations.
- peak_count=8, event_dominant_pattern=1: Supports daily peaks.
- quality_* low issues: Reliable data, no clipping/uncertainty amplification needed.
- No major corrections triggered (e.g., no high changepoint, no drift, residuals near-zero).

**changepoint_trend_tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM):**
- changepoint_count/score=0: No truncation needed, use full history.
- slope_max=23 (uptrend momentum): Slight boost possible, but ref pred already captures.
- slope_second_diff_max=34: Acceleration present, no early reversal.
- flatline_ratio high but ref pred fluctuates appropriately → no constant output.
- No strong corrections; maintain ref pred dynamics.

**data_quality_tool (QUALITY GATE):**
- All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.01, quantization=0.12): High quality, no clipping or uncertainty expansion.

**Overall Correction Strategy:**
- Base: Use reference_prediction directly (strong foundation, matches diurnal pattern).
- Refinements: Minor level check - ref pred mean ~48.5 vs historical median 55.9; slight upward bias correction (+~2-3 avg) but volatility/momentum ok, and recent data shows evening peaks ~78-90 dropping to ~52 (matches ref decline).
- No exogenous values → no adjustment.
- No regime/quality issues → minimal changes.
- Final: Closely follow ref pred pattern/volatility, subtle shift up ~1-2 for median alignment, preserve fluctuations (no mono trend).
</tool_think>

**Timestamp Generation:**
- Last historical: ""2016-12-16 23:00:00""
- Next 24: 2016-12-17 00:00:00 to 2016-12-18 23:00:00 (hourly).

**Final Prediction Logic:**
- Start with ref pred array.
- Apply tiny median alignment (+1.5 avg shift) for level, but keep exact pattern/volatility.
- Ensures 24 floats, diurnal cycle (night low → day rise → evening peak → night decline).

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-18 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-19 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [37.59, 35.34, 35.81, 35.53, 37.55, 40.61, 48.03, 62.57, 67.28, 66.20, 64.98, 64.52, 63.13, 62.52, 61.91, 63.19, 66.43, 74.08, 75.25, 67.76, 61.54, 56.49, 53.59, 49.61]. This captures typical daily electricity price patterns: low overnight, rising morning, peak afternoon/evening, drop evening/night.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.89) and ""System load forecast"" (0.83). Electricity prices typically follow load/generation patterns (low night, peak day). Reference already aligns with this diurnal cycle. No specific exogenous values for forecast window provided, so minor refinement: ensure morning rise (hours 6-9) and evening peak (17-19) are prominent, which they are.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- High flatline_ratio=0.97: Data has many constant periods (e.g., 35.1 repeated), but reference_prediction shows realistic fluctuations matching typical EPF-BE volatility.
- slope_max=23.02, slope_second_diff_max=34.17: Recent momentum captured in reference (rising to peaks).
- peak_count=7, low peak_spacing_cv=0.03: Regular daily peaks; reference maintains this.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference handles momentum.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.01, quantization=0.11). No clipping/uncertainty expansion required.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=57.49 (reference avg ~59, close), mad=12.15 (reference volatility matches), high acf1=0.90 (strong autocorrelation, reference preserves), low spec_entropy=0.28 (predictable signal). No bias correction needed.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation, aligns with correlations, handles flatline artifacts by injecting realistic diurnal fluctuations. No significant adjustments required - use it directly (minor rounding for float precision).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-08 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-09 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour each.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [41.34, 39.93, 38.23, 37.79, 39.93, 43.95, 51.26, 59.03, 62.06, 63.93, 61.40, 58.84, 55.92, 54.87, 54.38, 55.79, 59.42, 65.50, 67.95, 64.96, 60.07, 54.61, 52.41, 49.25]. This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak around hour 8-10, afternoon dip, evening peak around hour 18, then decline.

<tool_think>
**Comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool analysis:**
- High flatline_ratio (0.93) indicates many flat periods, but recent data shows normal diurnal variation (e.g., Dec 8: low night ~37, morning rise to 57, evening peak 68).
- No changepoints (score=0), so no regime shift; use full history.
- slope_max=37.71 (uptrend momentum, likely morning rise), slope_second_diff_max=62.47 (strong acceleration, supports peak building).
- peak_count=10 over 168h (~every 17h), sample_entropy=0.94 (predictable diurnal signal).
- No need for truncation, mean reversion, or flattening; maintain reference's fluctuations.

**exogenous_analysis:**
- Strong correlations: Generation forecast (0.80), System load forecast (0.74). No specific exogenous values for forecast window provided, so no direct adjustment possible. Reference likely incorporates similar patterns.

**data_quality_tool:**
- Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, quantization=0.095); data reliable, no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Overall correction:**
- No major corrections needed; reference captures diurnal cycle matching historical patterns (night low ~35-40, day peak ~60-70).
- Slight boost to morning/evening peaks (+0.5-1.0) due to slope_max momentum, but keep close to reference volatility (MAD~11).
- Final prediction uses reference with minimal rounding adjustments for float precision.
</tool_think>

Prediction closely follows reference_prediction pattern and volatility: gradual night decline to ~38, morning rise to peak ~64, afternoon stabilization ~55, evening peak ~68, night decline.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-20 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-21 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [52.358394, 47.936617, ..., 60.090272]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases, so final prediction must closely follow it.

Exogenous analysis: High correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.88) and ""System load forecast"" (0.84). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustments. Use as general confirmation that reference_prediction likely incorporates these influences.

Comprehensive features:
- Median 58.55, reference mean ~67 (slightly higher, minor positive bias possible but small).
- MAD 13.32 indicates moderate volatility, matching reference fluctuations.
- ACF1 0.92, ACF_s 0.55: Strong autocorrelation and seasonality - reference should capture this.
- Spec_entropy 0.28: Low (predictable signal).
- Changepoint_count/score 0: No regime shifts.
- Slope_max 20.3, slope_second_diff_max 25.7: Recent momentum captured in reference.
- Flatline_ratio 0.98 high but with peak_count 7 and sample_entropy 0.96: Structured daily cycles, not dead signal.
- Data quality good (low dropout/saturation).

Changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints, moderate slopes - no truncation/boost needed. Reference handles momentum.

Data_quality_tool: All ratios low - no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

Overall: Reference_prediction is reliable. No major corrections needed. Use it directly as it maintains volatility, daily cycle (night low ~45-50, morning rise to ~80 peak, evening decline), consistent with historical EPF-BE patterns.

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Base [52.36,47.94,...,60.09] - use as-is.
- exogenous_analysis: High correlations confirm model quality, no adjustment data.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Matches daily cycle, no bias/shift needed.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No regime change, momentum ok.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-22 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-23 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool**: Use the reference_prediction [46.68, 43.26, ..., 50.58] as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases, including diurnal cycle (night low ~40s, morning rise to ~70s peak, evening decline).

**Exogenous analysis**: High correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.84) and ""System load forecast"" (0.78). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Expect morning peak alignment with typical load/generation patterns.

**Changepoint & trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool)**:
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=23.5, slope_second_diff_max=25.7: Recent momentum present but not extreme; reference already incorporates.
- flatline_ratio=0.93 high: Some flat periods, but peak_count=7 indicates diurnal activity; reference shows proper fluctuations, no need for constant output.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; follow reference pattern.

**Data quality**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.02 low, quantization=0.12 minor). No clipping or uncertainty expansion required.

**Comprehensive stats**:
- median=54.7, reference mean ~60 (rough calc), close enough, no major bias correction.
- acf1=0.91 high (persistent), acf_s=0.40 (seasonal), matches reference's smooth diurnal shape.
- spec_entropy=0.30 low (predictable), sample_entropy=0.95: Reference is appropriate, no noise smoothing needed.
- mad=13.6: Reference volatility matches historical.

**Final strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it aligns with all diagnostics. Maintains volatility, diurnal pattern (low night, peak ~10-18h, evening drop), no tool flags require adjustment.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-24 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-25 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):**
Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION: [40.52, 36.29, 33.63, 32.86, 34.32, 36.15, 39.70, 44.10, 47.15, 50.26, 52.60, 54.58, 54.07, 52.83, 50.15, 50.96, 54.38, 59.13, 60.79, 59.41, 53.71, 50.84, 51.90, 49.06]. This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak, high daytime, evening drop. MUST closely follow this pattern/volatility.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
Strong correlations: Generation forecast (0.83), System load forecast (0.79). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor refinement only. Base already incorporates similar cases, so no major adjustment needed.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=23.5, slope_second_diff_max=25.71: Recent momentum, but base prediction already captures uptrend to peak then decline.
- flatline_ratio=0.93 high: Some flat periods, but peak_count=7 shows diurnal cycles; base has fluctuations, so OK.
- monotone_duration low, sample_entropy=0.90: Predictable cycles, no mean reversion needed.
- No truncation/boost/reversal correction required; base aligns.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):**
quality_saturation_ratio=0.024 low, dropout=0, quantization=0.107: Good quality, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features:**
median=51.38, mad=11.29: Base prediction mean ~48.5 (slightly low), but within 1 MAD; no strong bias correction. acf1=0.91 high autocorrelation (diurnal), spec_entropy=0.35 low (predictable): Base pattern matches. No major corrections.

**Final Decision:**
Use reference_prediction directly as it captures optimal similar patterns. Minor smoothing for electricity price realism (slight interpolation), but preserve volatility/fluctuations. No exogenous values for adjustment. Output exactly 24 floats matched to timestamps.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-26 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-27 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool**: Use the reference_prediction [40.283227, 36.26732, ..., 42.309389] as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases. My prediction must closely follow its pattern: starts moderate (~40), dips to ~33-35 around hours 4-5, rises to morning peak ~54 around hour 10, fluctuates mid-50s daytime, evening peak ~56 at hour 19, then declines to ~42.

**Exogenous analysis**: Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.866) and ""System load forecast"" (0.821). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustments. Electricity prices typically follow load/generation patterns (low night, peak daytime/evening), which aligns well with reference_prediction's diurnal cycle. No major refinements needed.

**Comprehensive features & changepoint_trend**:
- High flatline_ratio (0.923) and flatline_hits (0.012), but also peak_count=8 and slope_max=23.5/slope_second_diff_max=25.71 indicate real dynamics with periods of stability interrupted by peaks.
- No changepoints (score=0), so no memory truncation.
- High acf1=0.92 shows strong autocorrelation; reference_prediction respects this.
- No momentum boost/reversal needed (monotone_duration low).
- Data quality good (low dropout/saturation), no clipping or uncertainty expansion.

**Other diagnostics**: Median=47.16, mad=10.44 (moderate volatility, matches reference). spec_entropy=0.46 (predictable signal). No major corrections required.

**Final strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it already incorporates similar historical patterns, diurnal cycles matching correlations, and appropriate volatility. Minor rounding to 2 decimals for consistency with input data style, but keep as floats. No significant deviations.

**Tool think summary**: Reference is optimal foundation. Exogenous supports diurnal pattern. No regime shifts, quality issues, or strong corrections indicated. Prediction follows reference closely.

1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-30 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-31 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (44.67, 41.31, ..., 44.75). This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases.

**Exogenous analysis**: Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.844) and ""System load forecast"" (0.744). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Maintain base pattern as it likely incorporates these influences.

**Statistical features (basic_statistics_tool)**:
- Median: 44.87 (base pred mean ~47.3, slight downward bias correction possible but minor ~2.4 diff, not significant).
- MAD: 8.63 (moderate volatility, matches base pred fluctuations).
- ACF1: 0.85, ACF_s: 0.62 (strong autocorrelation and seasonality, base pred shows daily cycle - good).
- Spec_entropy: 0.33 (low, predictable signal - trust base pred).
- No major bias correction needed.

**Trend & changepoint (changepoint_trend_tool)**:
- Changepoint_score/count: 0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- Slope_max: 26.13 (recent uptrend momentum, base pred shows evening peaks ~52-54, appropriate).
- Slope_second_diff_max: 32.97 (acceleration present, no reversal signal).
- Flatline_ratio: 0.95 (many flats, but base pred has fluctuations matching historical peaks/troughs).
- Peak_count: 13 (typical daily cycles preserved in base).

**Data quality**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.01), no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive**: Confirms no structural issues; base pred aligns with median level, volatility, and patterns. No injections/reversions required.

**Final decision**: Base prediction excellent match - strong daily cycle (night low ~37-44, morning rise, daytime ~47-52, evening peak ~52-54, night decline). Minor smoothing for flatline_ratio but preserve volatility. No significant deviations.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-28 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-29 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [39.017152, 36.789864, 34.517266, 35.118279, 34.623841, 36.570854, 41.634999, 49.196618, 55.116751, 57.890083, 57.667516, 56.822084, 54.862951, 53.776145, 50.34197, 51.662827, 53.891419, 59.40567, 59.673756, 57.126758, 52.395227, 46.42993, 45.167601, 42.956605]. This captures typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak, high daytime, evening drop.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.84) and ""System load forecast"" (0.80). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment. Expect prices to follow typical load patterns embedded in reference.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=26.13, slope_second_diff_max=32.97: Recent momentum present but not extreme; reference already incorporates.
- flatline_ratio=0.92 high, but flatline_hits=0.012 low, quality_quantization_score=0.12 minor: Data has plateaus (common in prices), but reliable (dropout=0, saturation=0.012 low). No clipping or invalidation needed.
- peak_count=9, acf1=0.89 high: Strong hourly autocorrelation and diurnal cycles matched in reference.
- No major corrections: reference follows realistic volatility (MAD~9), not flat/monotonic.

**Data Quality:** All ratios low (dropout=0, constant_channel=0), saturation minor: Prediction reliable, no uncertainty expansion/clipping.

**Overall:** Reference_prediction is optimal baseline matching EPF-BE diurnal patterns (night low ~35-40, morning rise to ~50-60, daytime peak ~55-60, evening drop). Minor refinements unnecessary given tool signals. Final prediction uses reference values directly to preserve pattern/volatility.

<tool_think>
All tools considered: base as foundation, no exogenous values for adjustment, no changepoint/quality issues requiring deviation, trends/cycles aligned.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-30 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-01 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [58.39, 50.50, 46.99, 48.71, 48.18, 60.66, 74.84, 94.67, 95.59, 98.11, 90.50, 85.46, 81.36, 77.89, 74.72, 76.15, 81.56, 88.95, 97.64, 89.56, 80.53, 68.83, 60.49, 53.91]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases - shows typical daily cycle: night low, morning rise, daytime peak, evening drop.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.65) and ""System load forecast"" (0.64). No specific future exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Qualitatively supports base prediction's peak during high-demand hours (daytime).

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- High slope_max=245.84 and slope_second_diff_max=481.01: Recent strong upward momentum (matches spikes on 11-30), but base prediction already incorporates this with peaks ~95-98.
- flatline_ratio=0.97 high but only in historical flat periods; recent data volatile with peaks (e.g., 360.77), so no dead signal - maintain volatility.
- peak_count=5, sample_entropy=0.46: Expect continued peaks, base matches.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; base prediction aligns.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** quality_saturation_ratio=0.024 low, no clipping needed. quality_dropout_ratio=0, reliable data.

**Comprehensive Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=52.89, mad=13.06. Base prediction mean ~75 (elevated due to recent spikes), volatility matches mad scale. acf1=0.69 high autocorrelation supports smooth continuation like base. No major bias correction needed.

**Final Strategy:** Closely follow reference_prediction pattern/volatility (night low ~50-60, morning rise to 90s peak, evening drop). Minor rounding for float precision. No significant deviations.
