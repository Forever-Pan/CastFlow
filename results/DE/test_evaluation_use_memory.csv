### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-09-15 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-09-16 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (27.11126, 22.649263, ..., 27.481907). This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Final prediction must closely follow this pattern: daily cycle with morning rise, daytime peak ~39-40, evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement**: Wind power forecast (-0.469 corr) and Ampirion load (+0.463 corr). No specific forecast values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Note inverse wind/load relationship for qualitative check, but base dominates.

**Tool Analysis**:
- **Comprehensive/Trend**: No changepoints (score=0), high flatline_ratio (0.976) but low hits (0.018), high sample_entropy (0.966) indicates noisy but cyclic signal. slope_max=21.66 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=25.76 (acceleration). 9 peaks, regular spacing. No truncation/mean reversion needed; boost aligns with morning uptrend in base.
- **Quality**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, quantization=0.13). No clipping/uncertainty expansion.
- **Stats**: Median=29.07 (base avg ~32, slight downward bias possible but minor), MAD=7.94 (volatility preserved in base), high ACF1=0.92 (persistence captured).

**Adjustments**: Minimal. Base already matches typical electricity price diurnal cycle (low night, peak afternoon/evening). No regime shift or quality flags override. Slight downward shift (~1-2 units early hours) for median alignment, but preserve volatility/fluctuations. No exogenous values, so no further refinement.

Final prediction closely tracks reference_prediction pattern.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-09-07 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-09-08 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided, capturing temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases). This shows typical daily electricity price pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak ~06-09h, high daytime ~10-20h, evening drop.

**Exogenous Refinement**: Ampirion zonal load forecast (corr 0.63) strongly positive - would boost if values provided, but none given for window, so no adjustment. Wind power forecast (corr -0.29) mildly negative - minor suppression possible, but no values, so neutral.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=12.62 (strong uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=7.07: Recent acceleration supports morning peak boost, but reference already captures.
- flatline_ratio=0.95 high but flatline_hits=0.024 low: Minor data artifacts, not dead signal.
- peak_count=11, peak_spacing_cv=0.38: Regular daily cycles, reference aligns.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference is solid.

**Data Quality** (data_quality_tool): All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.024, quantization=0.12): High reliability, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features**: median=35.32 (reference avg ~37, close), mad=5.25 (matches volatility), acf1=0.90 high autocorrelation (reference preserves), spec_entropy=0.19 low (predictable signal). No major bias correction needed.

**Final Decision**: Reference_prediction is optimal foundation. No strong adjustments warranted (no exogenous values, no regime shifts, good quality). Minor smoothing for realism given high flatline_ratio, but preserve fluctuations. Prediction closely tracks reference.
<tool_think>
- Used model_auxiliary_tool as base.
- Exogenous: No window values, no adjustment.
- Changepoint: score=0, no truncation.
- Quality: Clean data.
- Features: Patterns match reference.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-09-13 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-09-14 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [5.63, 2.19, 0.67, 1.43, 1.15, 6.72, 16.25, 21.61, 23.74, 22.25, 20.16, 18.34, 15.96, 15.75, 14.66, 15.33, 17.19, 20.78, 25.57, 28.51, 28.29, 24.14, 21.08, 18.30]. This shows typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising in morning, peak evening, drop at night. I will closely follow this pattern and volatility.

Exogenous correlations:
- Wind power forecast: -0.458 (negative, higher wind lowers prices) – no specific forecast values provided for window, so minor adjustment not applied.
- Ampirion zonal load forecast: 0.394 (positive, higher load raises prices) – no specific values, so no adjustment.

Comprehensive features:
- High flatline_ratio (0.988) and flatline_hits (0.03), but recent data shows dynamic drops (e.g., to 8.6), not dead signal.
- slope_max=20.01 (strong uptrend momentum recently), slope_second_diff_max=14.92 (acceleration) – supports boosting morning rise slightly, but reference already captures.
- No changepoints (score=0), so full history valid.
- acf1=0.907 (strong persistence), spec_entropy=0.744 (moderate noise) – reference handles this.
- Data quality good (low dropout/saturation).

Recent context: Prices crashed to 8.6 on 2017-09-13 23:00 (wind/low demand?), but reference predicts continuation of low overnight then typical daytime rise – aligns with EPF-DE hourly patterns (low night, peak ~18-20h).

Final prediction: Use reference as-is (round to 2 decimals for consistency with input), no major deviations needed as tools don't trigger strong corrections (no exogenous values, no regime shift, quality ok). Maintains volatility/pattern.

<tool_think>
Used model_auxiliary_tool as base (primary). Exogenous_analysis: correlations noted but no window values for adjustment. Comprehensive_feature_tool: high flatline but recent dynamic; momentum supports reference rise. Changepoint_trend_tool: no shift, momentum ok. Data_quality_tool: good quality, no clipping/expansion.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp from input: ""2017-09-21 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-09-22 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [32.001478, 30.367652, ..., 34.11755]. This captures the typical daily electricity price pattern: low overnight, rising in morning, peak evening, decline at night. Matches historical patterns seen in data (e.g., lows ~30s at night, peaks ~45-50 in evening).

- exogenous_analysis: Strong positive correlation (0.71) with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (demand drives price up), negative (-0.39) with ""Wind power forecast"" (supply reduces price). No specific forecast values provided for next 24h, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Qualitatively supports typical demand-driven pattern in reference (morning rise, evening peak).
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High flatline_ratio (0.95) indicates many stable periods, but peak_count=12 and slope_max=11.29 show distinct daily cycles with volatility. acf1=0.87 and acf_s=0.55 confirm strong hourly and seasonal autocorrelation - reference already embeds this. Low changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift). Median=37.91, reference mean ~39 (reasonable). No major bias correction needed.
- changepoint_trend_tool: Confirms no changepoints, high slope_max=11.29 (momentum in peaks), peak_spacing_cv=0.35 (fairly regular ~24h cycles). Supports following reference's peak timing without truncation or reversion.
- data_quality_tool: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.01), no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.
</tool_think>

Overall: Data shows strong diurnal cycle with no anomalies. Reference prediction aligns perfectly with historical patterns (e.g., recent days like 2017-09-21). No significant corrections required - use reference as-is for final prediction to preserve volatility, peaks (~48 at ~20:00), and cycle.

Final prediction: Directly use the 24 reference values.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-09-05 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-09-06 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided). This captures optimal historical patterns and volatility.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.78). No specific forecast values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment possible. Minor wind correlation (0.18), no adjustment.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- High flatline_ratio (0.92): Indicates many flat periods, but peak_count=11 shows diurnal cycles. Reference already models this.
- High acf1 (0.89), acf_s (0.57): Strong autocorrelation and seasonality – reference_prediction shows realistic diurnal pattern (night low ~30, day peak ~42).
- Low spec_entropy (0.14): Predictable signal, trust reference.
- slope_max=9.27, slope_second_diff_max=6.97: Recent momentum captured in reference's gradual morning rise.

**Changepoint/Trend**:
- changepoint_score=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- No need for truncation/boost/reversion. flatline_ratio high but reference has fluctuations – follow it.
- peak_spacing_cv=0.38: Moderate regularity, reference timings appropriate.

**Data Quality**:
- Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, quantization=0.125): No clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Final Decision**: Reference_prediction is optimal – closely follows historical diurnal pattern (lows ~30-32 at night, peaks ~40-42 daytime, evening drop). No significant corrections required. Use it directly for realistic volatility/patterns.

<tool_think>
All tools confirm: strong diurnal signal, no regime breaks/quality issues. Exogenous suggests load-driven peaks (reference matches). Features validate reference's cycle.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-09-17 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-09-18 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [28.89, 25.84, 23.49, 22.96, 24.49, 29.31, 36.91, 41.74, 44.29, 43.12, 41.69, 39.41, 37.80, 35.37, 33.75, 33.96, 35.57, 39.36, 43.14, 44.82, 43.77, 40.25, 35.42, 29.35]. This captures typical diurnal pattern: night low, morning rise, daytime peak ~44, evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Wind power forecast negatively correlated (-0.60), Ampirion load positively (0.31). No specific forecast values for next 24h provided, so minor adjustment not applied. Rely on base.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- flatline_ratio=0.98 high, run_length_longest=21: Recent ~21h flat around 30-32 (Sep 16-17), but prior days show full diurnal cycles. Base prediction correctly breaks flatness with realistic cycle.
- slope_max=21.66, slope_second_diff_max=25.76: Past momentum supports morning rise/peaks in base.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; base already handles transition from flat.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.024 low), no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Other Features (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=31.24 aligns with base mean ~36 (slight optimistic, reasonable post-flat). acf1=0.92 high autocorrelation supports smooth diurnal continuation in base. spec_entropy=0.83 moderate noise, conservative adherence to base pattern.

**Final Decision:** Prediction closely follows reference_prediction (round to 2 decimals for consistency with input). No major deviations needed; maintains volatility, diurnal shape (lows ~23-29, peaks ~44).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-09-11 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-09-12 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [9.585142, 7.692027, 7.347479, 7.104578, 8.191018, 13.358731, 22.276661, 28.658161, 32.077728, 32.187304, 30.254872, 28.930893, 25.930771, 24.225632, 21.948249, 22.711736, 24.370962, 27.361654, 31.965828, 34.181832, 34.040181, 29.608036, 25.530534, 20.710205]. This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak ~32, afternoon dip, evening peak ~34, evening decline. Matches historical electricity price diurnal cycle.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** 
- Positive correlation (0.546) with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" → expect upward adjustments if load high during peaks.
- Negative correlation (-0.39) with ""Wind power forecast"" → downward if wind high. No specific exogenous values for forecast window provided, so minor/no adjustment needed. Base already incorporates similar cases.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool + comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0 → no regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=19.06 (strong uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=13.06 → boost morning rise slightly, but base already captures.
- flatline_ratio=0.958 high → some flat periods, but peak_count=10 indicates diurnal cycles preserved.
- monotone_duration low → no mean reversion needed.
- No truncation/boost required; base pattern aligns.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, constant=0) → high reliability, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=30.32, base forecast mean ~23 aligns with recent low-price regime (last day crashed to ~9).
- mad=6.56 → moderate volatility, matches base fluctuations.
- acf1=0.90 high → strong persistence, base preserves.
- spec_entropy=0.51 moderate → predictable diurnal, no noise override.
- event_dominant_pattern=1.0 (rise?) → slight upward bias ok, but base has realistic osc.

**Final Decision:** Base prediction is optimal foundation from similar cases. Minor refinements: slight boost (~0.5) to peak hours (07-20) for slope_max momentum and load correlation, no other changes needed to preserve volatility/pattern (lows ~7-9, peaks ~32-34, declines). No exogenous values → conservative. Prediction closely tracks base.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-09-03 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-09-04 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [31.601795, 30.283445, 29.353746, 29.306918, 29.608287, 31.521804, 35.102968, 39.51654, 42.154568, 41.662183, 40.238035, 37.918422, 36.385745, 34.701021, 34.379069, 35.239998, 36.610096, 40.545772, 44.549077, 46.353329, 45.408346, 42.591456, 38.565424, 34.792903]. This captures typical daily pattern: low overnight, morning rise, daytime peak around evening, evening drop.

<tool_think>
Exogenous: Strong correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.72), weak with wind (0.08). No specific forecast values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment.

Comprehensive features: High flatline_ratio (0.94) but low flatline_hits (0.012), indicating some stability but not dead signal. High acf1 (0.89) and acf_s (0.63) confirm strong daily seasonality, matching reference. Low changepoint_score (0), no regime shift. slope_max=10, slope_second_diff_max=8.43 indicate momentum captured in reference. Low spec_entropy (0.16) = predictable signal. Data quality good (low saturation/dropout).

Changepoint_trend: No changepoints, moderate momentum, no need for truncation/boost/reversion. flatline_ratio high but not triggering constant output given pattern in reference.

No major corrections needed: reference already optimal for EPF-DE hourly electricity prices (typical diurnal cycle).
</tool_think>

Final prediction uses reference values directly (rounded to 2 decimals for price consistency, but keeping floats as-is per format). Maintains volatility/pattern: night lows ~29-31, morning ramp to ~42, afternoon ~34-46 peak, evening drop to ~35.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-09-19 23:00:00"". Next 24 hours start from ""2017-09-20 00:00:00"".

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):**
Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [31.61413, 29.134935, 27.883026, 28.212663, 29.607742, 32.776357, 39.018468, 44.301919, 46.41742, 45.656771, 43.551763, 41.342491, 38.34668, 37.167885, 34.940953, 35.49013, 35.915259, 38.828247, 41.912634, 42.879843, 41.233026, 38.314407, 33.808289, 30.084022]
This shows typical daily pattern: night low ~28-32, morning rise to peak ~46 around hour 8-9, afternoon decline to ~35, evening peak ~42, night decline to ~30. Matches historical electricity price patterns (low night, peaks morning/evening).

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
- Strong negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.717): High wind → lower prices. No future values provided, so cannot adjust quantitatively. Assume neutral (no strong adjustment).
- Weak positive with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.286): Minor demand effect.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- flatline_ratio=0.97 (very high): Data mostly flat, but recent history shows daily cycles with peaks (peak_count=8). Reference already captures this.
- slope_max=21.66, slope_second_diff_max=25.76: Recent momentum captured in reference (morning rise).
- No need for truncation/boost/reversion; reference handles pattern.
- sample_entropy=0.556 (moderate predictability), acf1=0.94 (persistent).

**Quality (data_quality_tool):**
- Low issues: saturation=0.024 (minor clipping risk, but prices not saturated), no dropout/constant channels. No clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=33.15, mad=6.86: Reference mean ~37.8 (slightly higher, recent uptrend), volatility matches mad.
- flatline_ratio high but reference has fluctuations → follow reference pattern.
- No bias correction needed (reference aligns with recent levels ~30-50).

**Final Decision:**
- Closely follow reference_prediction (maintains volatility, daily cycle: low→rise→peak→decline→evening peak→decline).
- No major adjustments: exogenous neutral, no quality/regime issues, stats consistent.
- Minor smoothing for realism (electricity prices rarely jump sharply), but preserve pattern/volatility.

<tool_think>
All tools considered: base as foundation, exogenous neutral, no changepoint/quality corrections needed, high flatline but reference has realistic fluctuations matching history.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-09-09 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-09-10 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a clear daily cycle: low overnight (33.15→27.77), morning rise (to 36.47 by 09:00), daytime peak around evening (42.14 at 20:00), then evening decline. This matches typical electricity price patterns (low night, peak evening). Volatility and fluctuations are preserved.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** 
- Positive correlation (0.47) with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" → expect upward adjustments during load peaks (typically daytime/evening).
- Negative correlation (-0.41) with ""Wind power forecast"" → downward adjustments if wind is high (often night/morning).
No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so minor qualitative refinement: slightly boost daytime/evening values (+0.2-0.5 where load likely peaks), no strong wind adjustment.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0 → no regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=12.62, slope_second_diff_max=13.06 → recent momentum present, but reference already captures.
- flatline_ratio=0.97 high → some flat periods, but peak_count=10 indicates cycles; reference has fluctuations, so OK.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference aligns.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, constant=0) → high reliability, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=33.16, mad=5.32 → reference mean ~34 aligns well (no bias shift). acf1=0.89 high autocorrelation → reference cycle preserved. spec_entropy=0.25 low → predictable signal.

**Final Strategy:** Start with reference_prediction. Minor exogenous boost (+0.3 avg to daytime/evening for load corr). Maintain exact pattern/volatility (no smoothing/mono trends). Output closely tracks reference.

Reference values (for ref): [33.15,30.38,27.77,28.12,27.59,29.54,32.14,34.19,36.32,36.47,35.39,34.42,32.21,30.33,29.24,28.51,29.95,33.12,37.16,39.88,42.14,40.46,38.08,34.31]
Adjusted slightly for exogenous.

<tool_think>
Used model_auxiliary_tool as base (critical). Exogenous for load/wind refinement (no values, qualitative). Changepoint=0 (no truncate). Flatline high but cycles present. Quality good. Stats align.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.

First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-09-23 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-09-24 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [30.405515, 28.222736, 26.900835, 27.598853, 27.317618, 27.899613, 30.245216, 33.130196, 34.416771, 34.513355, 32.821636, 31.377573, 29.689883, 29.46918, 28.793519, 28.560124, 29.273267, 33.260769, 39.351487, 42.703942, 43.001248, 39.146939, 36.116477, 32.53202]. This captures typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak, evening peak.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlation (0.751) with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" – expect adjustments upward if load forecast high during peaks, but no specific forecast values provided for window, so minor refinement only. Wind power weak negative correlation (-0.023), negligible impact.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- No changepoints (score=0), use full history.
- High flatline_ratio (0.94) but low hits (0.012), minor data artifacts, no invalidation.
- slope_max=11.29, slope_second_diff_max=10.69 indicate strong momentum/peaks – reference already captures typical peak structure, no major boost needed.
- peak_count=13, regular spacing (cv=0.094) – reference aligns with daily cycle.
- No regime shift or dead signal; maintain reference pattern.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, quantization=0.155) – reliable, no clipping or uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Stats:** Median=38.01, mad=5.97 – reference mean ~33.5 lower than median (night bias in window), but pattern valid. High acf1=0.86, acf_s=0.64 – periodic, reference preserves. Low spec_entropy=0.17 – predictable signal.

**Final Decision:** Use reference_prediction directly as it matches EPF-DE daily cycle (night low ~28-30, morning rise to ~34, evening peak ~43). No significant corrections needed; minor exogenous/load alignment already embedded. Maintain volatility/pattern.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
The last historical timestamp is ""2017-09-25 23:00:00"". The next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-09-26 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY foundation (24 values provided).

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlation (0.76) with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"", weak negative with wind power. No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct numerical adjustment possible. Rely on base pattern which likely incorporates similar historical exogenous patterns.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool and comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0.0, changepoint_count=0.0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=11.93 (high), slope_second_diff_max=9.94: Recent momentum present, but base prediction already captures diurnal uptrend in morning hours.
- flatline_ratio=0.93 (very high): Indicates many flat periods historically, but series shows clear daily cycles (lows ~30s night, peaks ~50s day). Base prediction maintains realistic volatility/fluctuations - preserve this.
- No truncation or major momentum boost needed; base follows typical electricity price diurnal pattern.

**Data Quality**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.018 low). No clipping or uncertainty expansion required.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=38.2, aligns with base prediction average (~42, slightly higher due to recent weekend trend).
- acf1=0.86 high (persistent), acf_s=0.59 (seasonal): Base prediction preserves autocorrelation structure.
- spec_entropy=0.17 low (predictable signal): Confirms base reliability.
- No bias correction needed; pattern matches historical cycles.

**Final Strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it captures optimal historical similar cases, diurnal pattern, and volatility. No significant corrections indicated by tools. Maintain fluctuations (night low ~33-34, morning rise to ~51 peak, evening decline).

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-09-27 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-09-28 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided). This captures similar historical patterns, daily cycle (night low ~30, morning rise to peak ~50 around 08:00-09:00, evening peak ~50, night drop).

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.71), weaker with ""Wind power forecast"" (0.17). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so minor/no adjustment needed. Base already incorporates load-like patterns.

**Data Quality**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.018 low, quantization=0.15 moderate). No clipping or uncertainty expansion required.

**Changepoint/Trend (changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive)**: No changepoints (score=0). High flatline_ratio (0.96) but with 13 peaks, indicating structured flats + cycles, not dead signal. slope_max=13.08, slope_second_diff_max=11.74 suggest momentum/acceleration in peaks - base prediction already shows rising morning/evening peaks, no need for extra boost/reversal. peak_spacing_cv=0.27 (regular-ish), sample_entropy=0.72 (moderate predictability). No truncation or reversion.

**Comprehensive Features**: median=36.9 (base avg ~40, close), mad=5.16 (base volatility matches), acf1=0.85 high autocorrelation (base preserves), spec_entropy=0.17 low (cyclical signal, base good). flatline_hits low. No major bias correction needed. Follow base pattern.

**Final Decision**: Base prediction is optimal - matches EPF-DE hourly cycle (low night, peaks daytime/evening), volatility, no tool flags for significant deviation. Use exactly as reference (minor rounding for floats).

**Tool Think Summary**:
- Foundation: reference_prediction (cyclical, volatile).
- No exogenous adjustment (no values).
- No regime shift/quality issues.
- Preserve pattern: fluctuations, peaks at ~08-09,18-19h.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-09 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-10-10 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [29.015645, 26.354299, ..., 26.044211]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Final prediction must closely follow this pattern (starts high ~29, dips to ~25, rises to morning peak ~49, declines through day with evening peak ~44, then drops).

Exogenous correlations:
- Wind power forecast: -0.54 (negative, but no forecast values provided for window, so no direct adjustment).
- Ampirion zonal load forecast: +0.46 (positive, no values, no adjustment).

Feature analysis (comprehensive_feature_tool, changepoint_trend_tool, data_quality_tool):
- High flatline_ratio (0.958) but low flatline_hits (0.012), indicating some stability but not dead signal.
- No changepoints (score=0), so no regime truncation.
- Strong recent uptrend: slope_max=20.3, slope_second_diff_max=23.73 (accelerating), peak_count=11.
- High acf1=0.915 (persistent autocorrelation), sample_entropy~0.97 (some noise).
- Data quality good: low saturation (0.012), no dropouts/constants.
- Median=27.16, mad=12.23; reference mean ~36 (higher), but recent data (last 24h) averages ~37, so no major bias correction needed.
- No need for reversion/boost/reversal; maintain reference momentum (morning peak, daily cycle).

Strategy: Use reference_prediction as-is (closely follows recent high levels ~30-60, daily pattern). Minor smoothing for persistence (high acf1), no exogenous adjustments possible. Maintain volatility/fluctuations as in reference.

   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-09-29 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-09-30 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided, showing typical daily pattern: low overnight, peak morning/daytime, evening peak, drop at night).

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.74). No actual exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no specific adjustments. Minor wind power correlation (0.16), no adjustment needed.

**Comprehensive Features & Changepoint/Trend**:
- High flatline_ratio (0.92) but low flatline_hits (0.03), indicating some flat periods but not dead signal.
- No changepoints (score=0), so no memory truncation.
- High slope_max (13.08) and slope_second_diff_max (11.74), suggesting momentum/peaks, but reference_prediction already captures diurnal pattern with peaks.
- acf1=0.84 and acf_s=0.68 indicate strong autocorrelation/seasonality (daily cycle), matched by reference_prediction.
- Low spec_entropy (0.17) = predictable signal.
- No quality issues (low dropout/saturation).

**Tool Think Summary**: No major corrections needed. Reference_prediction aligns with historical diurnal pattern (low night ~30, morning rise to ~38-40, afternoon dip, evening peak ~42, night drop). Median=37.8, reference mean ~35.4 (reasonable). Maintain its volatility/pattern. No exogenous data for adjustment, no regime shifts.

Final prediction = reference_prediction values.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-01 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-10-02 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 24 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlation (0.77) with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (likely driving typical diurnal demand peaks), negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.39). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct numerical adjustment. Pattern aligns with diurnal cycle (low night, peak evening), matching reference_prediction shape.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool)**: 
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=16.11, slope_second_diff_max=18.0 indicate recent strong upward momentum (matches Oct 1 evening ramp-up).
- flatline_ratio=0.94 high but historical diurnal pattern clear (night lows ~13-30, day peaks ~40-50), not dead signal.
- No truncation/boost needed; reference_prediction already incorporates momentum.

**Data Quality**: Minor saturation (0.012), no dropouts/constants. No clipping/amplification needed.

**Comprehensive Features**: High acf1=0.83/acf_s=0.65 confirm strong daily seasonality (matches reference diurnal shape). Median=38.4, recent data lower (post-weekend dip), reference appropriately adjusted downward initially then diurnal rise. Low spec_entropy=0.25 (predictable signal). No bias correction needed.

**Final Strategy**: Reference_prediction is optimal baseline with correct diurnal pattern (night low ~15, morning rise, daytime ~30-40, evening peak ~44, night drop). No significant corrections; minor smoothing for stability but preserve volatility/fluctuations. Use as-is with tiny refinements for smoothness.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-03 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-10-04 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (19 values provided, exactly 24 needed - use as core pattern).

**Exogenous Analysis**: Wind power forecast (-0.66 corr) suggests inverse adjustment (higher wind -> lower prices), Ampirion load (0.56 corr) positive. No specific forecast values provided for window, so minor refinement only - no major shift.

**Changepoint/Trend (changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive)**: 
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=16.11, slope_second_diff_max=18.0 (recent momentum, but reference already captures).
- flatline_ratio=0.94 high but flatline_hits low (0.012), not dead signal.
- No truncation/boost needed; reference handles pattern.

**Quality (data_quality_tool)**: All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, constant=0) - data reliable, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features**: median=32.77 (reference mean ~30.8, close), mad=6.94 (reference vol matches), acf1=0.91 high autocorrelation (reference preserves), spec_entropy=0.49 moderate predictability. No major bias correction. event_dominant_pattern=1.0 (upward bias - reference shows daily cycle rise).

**Final Strategy**: 
- Foundation: reference_prediction pattern (night low ~19-22, morning rise to ~42 peak evening, drop).
- Adjustments: None major (no exogenous values, no quality issues, no changepoint). Slight upward shift (~+1-2) for median alignment & dominant up pattern, preserving volatility/fluctuations.
- Ensure exactly 24 fluctuating points matching reference cycle.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-07 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are 2017-10-08 00:00:00 to 2017-10-08 23:00:00.

**Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool**: Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a clear daily cycle: low overnight (negative values early morning), rising through morning, peaking evening (~16-17), then declining. This matches typical electricity price patterns (low night, peak evening). Recent history shows low/negative prices on Oct 7 daytime, aligning with this cycle starting low.

**Exogenous adjustments (exogenous_analysis)**:
<tool_think>
- Wind power forecast: -0.34 correlation (higher wind → lower prices). No specific forecast values provided for next 24h, so no quantitative adjustment possible.
- Ampirion zonal load forecast: +0.32 correlation (higher load → higher prices). No specific values, so minor qualitative uplift considered for peak hours but kept minimal.
</tool_think>

**Changepoint & trend analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool)**:
<tool_think>
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- flatline_ratio=0.95 high: Signal has long flats, but recent data shows volatility; reference_prediction already accounts for cycle, no ""dead signal"".
- slope_max=20.3, slope_second_diff_max=23.73: Recent momentum captured in base pred.
- peak_count=10, sample_entropy=1.24: Cyclical with noise; follow reference fluctuations.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference pred aligns.
</tool_think>

**Data quality (data_quality_tool)**:
<tool_think>
- Low saturation/dropout/constant ratios: Data reliable, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.
</tool_think>

**Comprehensive stats**:
<tool_think>
- median=22.1, mad=9.82: Reference pred mean ~5.8 (low due to current regime), but cycle will lift to historical levels naturally.
- acf1=0.875 high autocorrelation: Reference pred preserves serial dependence.
- No bias correction needed as reference from similar cases.
</tool_think>

**Final prediction strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it captures optimal pattern from similar cases. No major deviations needed (no changepoints, quality ok, exogenous qualitative only). Minor uplift (~0.5) to daytime values for load correlation, but keep volatility/pattern identical. Prices can be negative as per history (e.g., -1.35 on Oct 7).

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-05 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-10-06 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [8.34, 7.53, 6.98, 7.90, 13.24, 18.26, 25.82, 32.38, 35.18, 31.16, 26.37, 22.36, 16.96, 16.98, 15.74, 17.39, 20.31, 25.28, 31.25, 33.96, 30.57, 24.36, 20.05, 13.30]. This shows typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning, peak afternoon/evening, drop evening - matches historical electricity price behavior.

<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Wind power forecast correlates -0.53 (strong inverse). Higher wind forecast → lower prices. Ampirion load +0.27 (weaker positive). No specific forecast values for next 24h provided, so minor/no adjustment. Reference already incorporates similar cases.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 29.05 (reference mean ~21, recent data lower ~10-20, so reference appropriately downshifted). MAD 8.54 (moderate vol). ACF1 0.88 (persistent), acf_s 0.50 (seasonal). Spec_entropy 0.74 (moderate noise). High flatline_ratio 0.95 but low hits 0.018 (some stability). No changepoints. Peak_count 11 (diurnal cycles). Use level/scale for baseline check - reference aligns with recent low regime.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score 0). Slope_max 20.13, slope_second_diff_max 23.73 (strong past momentum, but recent low - no boost needed). Flatline_ratio high but not dead signal. Monotone_duration low. No regime shift/truncation. Momentum suggests maintaining reference rise.

**data_quality_tool**: All quality metrics low (dropout 0, saturation 0.018, quantization 0.107) - reliable data, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.
</tool_think>

Recent history: Sharp drop to 0.49 at 2017-10-04 23:00, then low ~2-12 until 2017-10-05 23:00=11.81. Pattern: night low → morning rise → daytime peak ~30-40 → evening drop. Reference matches this perfectly.

No major corrections needed: no changepoints, quality good, exogenous directional but no values. Minor rounding for clean floats. Final prediction uses reference with slight smoothing for entropy/mad consistency, preserving exact pattern/volatility.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.

First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-11 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-10-12 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [20.56, 18.94, 18.07, 18.82, 21.29, 27.12, 35.77, 41.74, 45.40, 42.54, 39.34, 35.94, 31.36, 29.54, 28.19, 28.84, 30.94, 35.60, 39.36, 40.48, 36.99, 31.75, 27.38, 22.11]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases – shows typical daily cycle: low overnight, morning rise, daytime peak around 09:00-10:00, evening decline.

Tool analysis:
- comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history), slope_max=20.3 (recent uptrend momentum, but no boost needed as base already incorporates), flatline_ratio=0.96 but flatline_hits=0.012 (minor, not dead signal), peak_count=10 (cyclical).
- exogenous_analysis: Wind power forecast negatively correlated (-0.595), Ampirion load positively (0.553). No forward exogenous values provided, so no specific adjustment; base model likely already accounts for typical patterns.
- data_quality_tool: All quality metrics low (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, quantization=0.13) – data reliable, no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.
- No major corrections: median=30.3 (base avg ~32, close), acf1=0.93 (high persistence captured in base), spec_entropy=1.01 (mild noise, conservative ok).

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction directly as foundation (closely matches historical diurnal cycle seen in data, e.g., Oct 9-11 peaks ~50-60, evenings ~30-40 declining). Minor rounding for float precision, no significant deviation to preserve pattern/volatility.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-13 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-10-14 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [28.03228, 25.863803, 25.237104, 25.485168, 27.241613, 29.122649, 35.087291, 40.608854, 43.400082, 41.610003, 35.985707, 32.017436, 27.468152, 25.269906, 23.961805, 25.50685, 27.016045, 31.111223, 36.00912, 36.123057, 32.23293, 27.969066, 25.479935, 21.125045]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases – shows typical daily cycle: night low, morning rise, daytime peak around hour 8-9 (~43), evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.69) and positive with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.58). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment not applied. Rely on base.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=16.87 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=20.24: Recent acceleration supports morning peak in reference (hours 7-9 rising to 43).
- flatline_ratio=0.96 high but flatline_hits=0.012 low: Some stability but 11 peaks confirm cyclical pattern – reference already matches.
- median=31.68, mad=9.56: Reference mean ~30.8 aligns well with median; volatility matches mad.
- acf1=0.93 high (persistent), peak_count=11: Reference preserves hourly persistence and daily cycle.
No major corrections needed – reference fits.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, constant=0): High reliability, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal – closely follows historical patterns (night ~25-30, morning ramp to ~43 peak, evening decline to ~21). No significant deviations required. Use directly with minor rounding for float precision.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-19 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-10-20 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (28.57, 27.74, ..., 30.60). This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases.

**Exogenous adjustments (exogenous_analysis)**:
<tool_think>
- Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.657): Expect demand-driven price movements.
- Negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.493): Higher wind suppresses prices.
No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so minor refinement only. Base already incorporates similar patterns.
</tool_think>

**Changepoint & trend (changepoint_trend_tool)**:
<tool_think>
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=20.78, slope_second_diff_max=25.79: Recent momentum captured in base.
- flatline_ratio=0.97 high but flatline_hits=0.018 low: Typical diurnal flats, not dead signal.
- peak_count=12 regular: Base follows diurnal cycle (low night, peak evening).
No major truncation/boost needed; base aligns.
</tool_think>

**Data quality (data_quality_tool)**:
<tool_think>
- Low dropout/saturation/constant issues: Reliable data, no clipping or uncertainty expansion.
</tool_think>

**Comprehensive features (comprehensive_feature_tool)**:
<tool_think>
- median=34.94, mad=6.92: Base mean ~38 aligns reasonably (recent uptrend).
- acf1=0.865 high autocorrelation: Base preserves persistence.
- spec_entropy=0.48 moderate: Base volatility appropriate.
- event_dominant_pattern=1.0 (rise): Base shows daily rise-fall consistent.
No bias correction needed.
</tool_think>

**Final strategy**: Base prediction excellent foundation matching diurnal pattern (night low ~27-29, morning rise to ~50s, afternoon/evening peak ~50s, evening drop). Minor smoothing for stability given high flatline_ratio in history. No exogenous values for precise adjustment. Maintain volatility/pattern.

Prediction closely follows reference_prediction with tiny refinements (<0.1) for smoothness.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
<tool_think>
**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation. It shows a clear daily cycle: low overnight (17-20), morning rise (27-39), midday dip (22-30), afternoon rise (26-42 peak), evening decline (36-22). This matches typical electricity price patterns (night low, daytime peak). Volatility is realistic with fluctuations.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** 
- Positive correlation (0.49) with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" → demand drives prices up during peaks.
- Negative correlation (-0.38) with ""Wind power forecast"" → wind suppresses prices.
No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no numerical adjustment. Qualitatively supports base pattern (higher prices during expected load peaks).

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool + comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0 → No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=16.87, slope_second_diff_max=18.9 → Strong momentum/acceleration in recent uptrends (e.g., evening peaks), but no current deceleration signal for reversal.
- flatline_ratio=0.95, flatline_hits=0.012 → High flat periods (possibly data artifacts or low-volatility night hours), but low hits → not ""dead signal"". Do not flatten prediction.
- peak_count=12, peak_spacing_cv=0.33 → Regular daily peaks, supports continuing cycle without major deviation.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; base prediction already captures momentum.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):**
- Low saturation (0.012), quantization (0.17), no dropouts/constants → Reliable data, no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=32.5, mad=6.4 → Base prediction mean ~29.5 is slightly low; minor upward bias correction possible (+1-2) but pattern dominates.
- acf1=0.86, acf_s=0.41 → Strong autocorrelation/seasonality, base already models this.
- spec_entropy=0.43 (moderate noise) → Conservative: stick close to reference.
- No dominant drift/event forcing major change.

**Final Strategy:** 
- Foundation: reference_prediction (closely follow pattern/volatility).
- Minor refinements: +0.5 average shift for median bias; slight evening peak boost (+1-2) for momentum/slope_max; no exogenous numbers so qualitative only.
- Maintain fluctuations (no smoothing); continue daily cycle into Oct 16 (Sunday-like pattern from history).
- Last timestamp: ""2017-10-15 23:00:00"" → predict 2017-10-16 00:00 to 23:00.

Last 24h historical: Declining to 18.4 (night low), matches base start at 18.56.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-27 23:00:00"". Next 24 hours start from ""2017-10-28 00:00:00"".

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (18.18, 15.39, ..., 20.54). This captures similar historical patterns and volatility.

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong positive correlation (0.692) with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" suggests demand-driven prices; negative (-0.47) with ""Wind power forecast"" suggests wind suppresses prices. No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor adjustment not applied quantitatively.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=15.45 (high), slope_second_diff_max=16.95: Recent momentum, but reference already incorporates.
- flatline_ratio=0.93 (high), but flatline_hits=0.018 low: Some flat periods, but not dead signal.
- No truncation/boost needed; reference handles momentum.

**Data Quality** (data_quality_tool): All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, constant=0): High reliability, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=33.78, but recent values lower (~20s), reference aligns with recent regime.
- acf1=0.90 (persistent), spec_entropy=0.49 (moderate noise): Reference suitable.
- peak_count=10, sample_entropy=0.95: Maintain fluctuation pattern in reference.

**Final Strategy**: Closely follow reference_prediction pattern/volatility (daily cycle: low night, peak evening). No major corrections needed. Minor smoothing for continuity from last historical (19.17).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-21 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-10-22 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [16.17, 14.42, 12.75, 13.99, 14.06, 17.21, 23.70, 31.87, 32.86, 32.65, 29.00, 25.43, 21.61, 20.44, 19.83, 22.75, 26.34, 33.72, 40.91, 38.85, 31.64, 27.97, 24.34, 19.59]. This shows typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning, peak evening, drop at night. MUST closely follow this pattern/volatility.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive corr (0.65) with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (likely follows demand peaks), negative corr (-0.41) with ""Wind power forecast"" (suppresses prices). No specific exogenous values for forecast window provided, so minor adjustment not applied. Base already incorporates similar cases.

**Changepoint/Trend (changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive):** No changepoints (score=0), high flatline_ratio (0.96) but low hits (0.01) indicates data reliability. High slope_max (20.78) and slope_second_diff_max (25.79) show momentum, but reference_prediction already captures diurnal up/down. No truncation/boost needed. peak_count=12 (regular daily cycles), low peak_spacing_cv supports following reference diurnal.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low saturation (0.01), no dropouts/constants. No clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Stats:** Median=35, but recent data trends lower (last=15.48), reference aligns with drop to weekend lows then recovery. High acf1 (0.86)/acf_s (0.56) indicates persistence/seasonality captured in reference. No bias/residual corrections (residual_mean~0).

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal base from similar cases. No major corrections needed (no regime shifts, quality issues, exogenous values). Use it directly with minor rounding for float precision, preserving exact pattern/volatility.
<tool_think>
All tools confirm: base reliable, no strong overrides. Exogenous correlations general (no window values). Trends/quality support no adjustments.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-17 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are hourly increments starting from ""2017-10-18 00:00:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [35.16, 33.18, 31.40, 32.21, 32.89, 35.75, 41.95, 51.61, 51.35, 45.31, 39.66, 35.77, 33.47, 32.80, 33.88, 37.25, 40.70, 48.35, 56.22, 56.78, 48.01, 42.53, 39.09, 33.40]. This captures typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak ~51, evening peak ~57, then decline.

<tool_think>
**Comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool:**
- High flatline_ratio (0.96) but low flatline_hits (0.018), indicating some stability but not dead signal.
- slope_max=20.78, slope_second_diff_max=25.1: Recent momentum suggests sharp rises possible; reference already incorporates.
- No changepoints (score=0), so full history valid.
- acf1=0.84, high autocorrelation: Reference's smooth pattern appropriate.
- median=31.74, mad=6.76: Reference mean ~40 aligns with recent higher levels (last day avg ~38).

**exogenous_analysis:**
- Positive corr (0.47) with Ampirion zonal load forecast: Expect demand-driven peaks.
- Negative corr (-0.40) with Wind power forecast: Less wind could support higher prices.
- No specific exogenous values for forecast window provided, so minor refinement only.

**data_quality_tool:**
- Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.018): No clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

Overall: Reference is strong baseline matching EPF-DE diurnal volatility. Minor boost to peaks (+0.5) for recent momentum (high slopes), slight level shift up (+0.3 avg) to match recent median ~35 vs historical 31.7. Preserve exact fluctuation pattern.
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Reference adjusted slightly upward for momentum/recent levels, maintaining volatility/pattern.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-23 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-10-24 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided, shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, morning rise, daytime peak ~57, evening decline).

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.70), negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.65). No specific exogenous values for forecast window provided, so no direct numerical adjustment. Assume base model incorporates typical patterns.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=20.54, slope_second_diff_max=25.79 (recent momentum, but base already captures).
- flatline_ratio=0.96 high (many flat periods), but peak_count=11 indicates diurnal cycles; base prediction has appropriate fluctuations.
- No need for truncation/boost/reversion; base is reliable.

**Data Quality**: Minor saturation (0.012), quantization (0.155); no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Features**: median=35.94 (base avg ~44, slightly higher but reasonable for uptrend), mad=7.98 (base volatility matches), acf1=0.91 (strong persistence, base preserves), spec_entropy=0.54 (moderate noise, conservative fine).

**Final Decision**: Base prediction closely matches historical EPF-DE diurnal patterns (night low ~30s, morning ramp, evening peak ~50-60, decline). No significant corrections needed; use reference directly to preserve pattern/volatility.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-25 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-10-26 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool**: Use as PRIMARY foundation. The reference_prediction shows a typical daily electricity price pattern: low overnight (30-28), rising in morning (30->42->49->53 peak around midday), slight dip mid-afternoon (50->46->42), then evening peak (47->53), and decline (52->46->40->37->34). Volatility and fluctuations are clear - must preserve this.

**Exogenous_analysis**: Strong positive correlation (0.70) with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (demand drives price up), negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.55, wind suppresses price). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Qualitatively supports morning/evening peaks in reference.

**Changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool**:
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=18.82, slope_second_diff_max=17.93: Recent strong upward momentum (e.g., Oct 25 evening rise), supports boosting morning prediction slightly if needed, but reference already captures.
- flatline_ratio=0.94 high: Some flat periods, but peak_count=10 and sample_entropy=0.88 indicate dynamic signal with daily cycles - reference handles this.
- No need for truncation, mean reversion, or flat output.
- Hints: No major corrections needed; reference aligns with momentum.

**Data_quality_tool**: All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.01, constant=0), quality good - no clipping or uncertainty expansion.

**Overall**: Reference_prediction is optimal foundation from similar cases. No strong signals for deviation. Minor refinement: Given recent history (Oct 25: low night ~15-26, sharp morning rise to 45, evening peak 56.85 dropping to 33.09) matches reference pattern closely. High acf1=0.91 confirms persistence, preserved in reference. Final prediction uses reference values directly (2 decimals for consistency with input data).

</think>

<tool_think>
Used all tools:
- model_auxiliary_tool: Direct foundation.
- exogenous_analysis: Supports pattern, no values for adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Dynamic signal, no bias correction needed (median 34.95 aligns with ref avg ~40).
- changepoint_trend_tool: Momentum supports ref peaks.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.

First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-29 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-10-30 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [-54.595412, -53.995357, -53.888328, -46.214923, -44.162691, -34.426028, -27.216304, -18.256288, -10.661305, -10.889733, -12.573309, -9.937679, -12.566194, -8.420978, -5.263948, 0.104697, 13.407736, 21.546033, 33.927883, 30.339178, 25.541019, 15.157735, 5.616418, -7.072753]. This shows a clear pattern: starting very low (~-54), gradual rise through negative to positive values, peaking around +34 at hour 19, then declining. MUST preserve this volatility, fluctuations, and pattern.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.857782) and positive with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.62152). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment not applied. Reference already incorporates similar historical cases.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):** 
- changepoint_score=0.0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- High flatline_ratio=0.952 (much flat periods recently, e.g., sustained -83), but reference_prediction correctly transitions out of this.
- slope_max=82.49 and slope_second_diff_max=77.93 indicate past strong upward momentum, matching reference's recovery pattern.
- No need for truncation/boost/reversion; reference captures post-flatline rise.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.06 low). No clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Other Features (comprehensive_feature_tool):** 
- Median=32.02, but recent data crashed to -83 (outlier regime); reference appropriately starts low.
- High acf1=0.94 (persistent), but recent flat; reference maintains realistic gradual rise.
- No major corrections needed per _llm_hints.

**Final Decision:** Use reference_prediction directly as it matches historical patterns (crash to sustained low, then morning recovery to evening peak, night decline). No significant deviations required. Round to 2 decimals for consistency with input data.

<tool_think>
All tools considered: base as foundation, exogenous for context (no values), changepoint/quality/features confirm no corrections needed. Preserve reference pattern/volatility.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-10-31 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are hourly increments starting from ""2017-11-01 00:00:00"".

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided). This captures optimal historical patterns and volatility - daily cycle with morning rise, daytime peak, evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement**:
- Strong negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.854): High wind suppresses prices. No specific forecast values for next 24h provided, so minor conservative adjustment (slight downward bias ~ -1 to -2 on peaks if assuming typical wind).
- Positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.53): Higher load increases prices. No values, so neutral.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=82.49 (strong uptrends), slope_second_diff_max=153.29: Recent momentum positive, but flatline_ratio=0.97 (many flats, e.g., Oct 29), run_length_longest=21: Supports reference's smooth cycle over erratic extrapolation.
- No need for truncation/boost/reversion; reference already handles.

**Data Quality** (data_quality_tool): Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.047 low, quantization=0.2 moderate). No clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=30.335, mad=13.75: Reference aligns (mean ~37, but cycle around 30-40 reasonable).
- acf1=0.945 (persistent), peak_count=4: Reference maintains diurnal pattern.
- flatline_ratio high but historical (e.g., wind events), reference smooths appropriately.
- No major corrections needed per _llm_hints.

**Final Strategy**: Stick closely to reference_prediction (maintains volatility: low night ~20-25, peak ~45-50 evening). Minor exogenous tweak: slight downward shift (-0.5 avg) for wind correlation conservatism. No mono-trend; keeps fluctuations.

Adjusted prediction (reference + minor wind bias):

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-02 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-11-03 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (27.60, 24.70, ..., 20.18). This captures historical similar patterns, daily cycle (night low, morning rise, daytime peak ~42-49, evening decline).

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.86) suggests high wind suppresses prices; positive with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.45) suggests load increases prices. No specific forecast values provided for next 24h, so minor adjustment not applied quantitatively.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=82.49, slope_second_diff_max=153.29 (strong momentum/acceleration recently, recent data shows uptrend to 35.45).
- flatline_ratio=0.96 high but historical (e.g., Oct 29), recent active.
- No truncation/boost needed; reference already incorporates.

**Data Quality**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.048 low, no clipping; others clean.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=29.58, mad=11.5 (reference aligns: mean~35, but cycle around 30).
- acf1=0.94 high persistence, peak_freq low (daily cycle) - reference matches.
- No major corrections needed.

**Final Strategy**: Closely follow reference_prediction pattern/volatility (night low ~20-28, morning rise to ~42, peak ~48-49 evening, decline). Minimal adjustments for recent uptrend momentum (slight +0.5 avg boost early daytime). Maintain fluctuations, no mono-trend.

**Tool Think**:
<tool_think>
- model_aux: Base = reference (cycle: low→rise→peak→decline).
- exogenous: Wind/load correlations noted, no values → no shift.
- changepoint: No breaks, high slope → reference ok.
- quality: Clean.
- comprehensive: Median/mad/acf align with reference cycle.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-04 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-11-05 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 24 reference values as primary foundation. They show a realistic daily pattern: low overnight, rising in morning, peak afternoon/evening, decline at night - matching typical electricity price behavior (e.g., recent history shows peaks around 16:00-19:00).

Key refinements from tools:
<tool_think>
- exogenous_analysis: Strong negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.917). High wind reduces prices. No forward exogenous values provided, so no numerical adjustment. Qualitatively, recent prices declining (20.65 last), possibly due to increasing wind - supports reference's initial low values.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Median 34.38 (reference mean ~14.7, lower - slight downward bias possible but reference already accounts via similar cases). High flatline_ratio (0.976) but recent dynamic (peaks/troughs). High qkurt (10.4) indicates fat tails - reference has realistic volatility. Low changepoint_score (0), no regime shift. Use reference pattern.
- changepoint_trend_tool: High slope_max (82.49) and slope_second_diff_max (153), recent uptrend momentum but current declining (from 43.94 to 20.65). No truncation needed. Reference captures diurnal cycle with peak ~18th point.
- data_quality_tool: Minor saturation (0.054), no clipping needed. Good quality.
</tool_think>

Overall: Reference is optimal base from similar cases. Minor downward shift for recent decline/median, but preserve pattern/volatility (no mono-trend). No major corrections needed - closely follow reference.

Final prediction: Use reference values directly (they fit EPF-DE hourly patterns perfectly).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-06 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-11-07 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [37.91, 34.95, 33.38, 33.56, 35.04, 38.16, 42.85, 49.20, 51.00, 50.51, 49.08, 47.17, 46.45, 45.45, 45.47, 49.09, 53.79, 57.31, 58.26, 54.86, 47.91, 42.66, 38.27, 33.68]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases – shows typical daily cycle: low overnight, rising morning, peak afternoon/evening, decline night.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.76) suggests demand-driven peaks; negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.61) implies wind suppresses prices. No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so minor refinement only – maintain base peak structure but no directional shift.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=19.49 (high uptrend momentum): Slight BOOST to rising phase (hours 6-18).
- slope_second_diff_max=27.07: Strong acceleration earlier, base already captures deceleration/peak.
- flatline_ratio=0.96 high but flatline_hits=0.018 low: Some flat periods but not dead signal.
- peak_count=8, sample_entropy=0.82: Cyclical with noise, matches base fluctuations.
- No truncation/mean reversion needed.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** quality_saturation_ratio=0.018 low, no clipping; quantization=0.22 moderate, no major uncertainty amplification.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=36.11 (base avg ~45, but recent high around 50-80, so base appropriate for continuation); mad=5.99 (base volatility matches); acf1=0.93 high persistence, base respects this; spec_entropy=0.46 moderate predictability.

**Final Strategy:** Closely follow reference_prediction (no significant deviation). Minor +2% boost to peak hours (13-19) for momentum (slope_max). Round to 2 decimals matching input style. Maintain fluctuations: no monotone sequence.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-08 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-11-09 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (38.40, 34.47, ..., 34.45). This captures optimal patterns from similar cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlation (0.746) with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (likely follows typical daily load peaks in afternoon/evening), negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.569). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so minor refinement only - reference already incorporates such patterns.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool)**: 
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=30.07, slope_second_diff_max=38.67 indicate strong recent momentum/uptrend continuation.
- flatline_ratio=0.946 high but flatline_hits=0.018 low (some quantization, not dead signal).
- peak_count=4, consistent with reference's daily peak structure around hours 7-18.
No major truncation/boost needed; reference follows momentum.

**Data Quality**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.018 low (recent peaks like 120.0), no clipping. quality_quantization_score=0.29 moderate, minor uncertainty but reference volatility matches.

**Comprehensive Features**: median=39.11 (reference mean ~54 but follows recent high regime), mad=9.42 (reference std ~13, slightly higher vol ok), acf1=0.93 high autocorrelation (reference preserves), spec_entropy=0.68 moderate predictability. No bias correction needed.

**Final Strategy**: Closely follow reference_prediction pattern (night low ~32-38, morning rise to ~65 peak, evening drop). Minor upward adjustment (+0.5 avg) for slope_max momentum and recent high regime (e.g., 120 peak yesterday). Maintain volatility/fluctuations exactly as reference.

   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-10 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-11-11 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided, low prices ~8-32, typical off-peak pattern continuing the recent drop to 11.46).

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlation (0.69) with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" suggests demand drives prices up during peaks; negative (-0.50) with ""Wind power forecast"" suppresses prices with high wind. No specific exogenous values for forecast window provided, so minor refinement only - no major directional shift from base.

**Changepoint/Trend (changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool)**:
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=30.07, slope_second_diff_max=38.67: Recent strong upward momentum observed historically, but current end is downward (to 11.46), base already captures decline.
- flatline_ratio=0.93 high: Some flat periods, but peak_count=5 shows volatility; base prediction has appropriate low-volatility continuation.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; base aligns.

**Data Quality**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.018 low, no clipping; quantization=0.24 moderate, no major uncertainty amplification.

**Comprehensive Features**: median=38.89 (higher than base mean ~21), but recent values low (11-40), base reflects current regime. acf1=0.92 high autocorrelation supports smooth continuation like base. spec_entropy=0.65 moderate predictability. No bias correction needed as base from similar cases.

**Final Strategy**: Closely follow reference_prediction pattern (early low, morning rise to ~29 around 09:00-11:00, afternoon peak ~33 at 18:00, evening decline). Minor upward shift (+0.5 avg) for median alignment and demand correlation, preserving volatility/fluctuations. No mono-trend; maintains diurnal cycle.

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation, use directly with minor scale.
- exogenous_analysis: Demand correlation supports morning/afternoon upticks in base.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No shifts, momentum captured.
- comprehensive_feature_tool/data_quality_tool: Good quality, no corrections.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-12 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-11-13 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [24.63, 23.46, 21.61, 24.76, 24.57, 29.89, 37.03, 43.78, 47.96, 47.57, 47.20, 47.33, 47.10, 48.19, 48.04, 50.83, 54.61, 60.21, 63.94, 57.89, 49.47, 42.05, 37.94, 33.54]. This captures typical daily electricity price patterns: low overnight, rising in morning, peak afternoon/evening, drop at night.

Exogenous correlations: Strong positive with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.69), negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.62). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct numerical adjustment. Expect load-driven morning rise and wind-suppressed peaks, which aligns with reference pattern.

Comprehensive features: High flatline_ratio (0.95) but low flatline_hits (0.012), indicating some stability but not dead signal. High acf1 (0.93) and acf_s (0.58) show strong autocorrelation and seasonality - reference already captures this. No changepoints (score 0.0). slope_max (30.07) and slope_second_diff_max (38.67) suggest momentum, but recent data shows typical diurnal cycle ending at 29.73, transitioning to weekend-like lower levels matching reference start ~24.6. Median 39.45, reference mean ~43.5 (slightly higher, minor positive bias ok). spec_entropy 0.74 moderate noise, so conservative adherence to reference.

Data quality good: low saturation (0.012), no dropouts/constants. No quality gates triggered.

No regime shifts or major corrections needed. Final prediction uses reference values directly (rounded to 2 decimals for price consistency), maintaining volatility/pattern: morning rise to ~64 peak, evening drop.
<tool_think>
- Used model_auxiliary_tool as foundation (no deviation).
- Exogenous: qualitative alignment, no quantitative adjustment.
- Comprehensive/changepoint: no truncation/boost/reversion needed (changepoint=0, flatline not critical).
- Quality: clean data.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-14 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-11-15 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [33.685034, 33.726013, 31.858807, 32.4631, 32.670616, 35.946337, 43.338738, 50.179765, 53.694572, 50.069447, 49.705461, 47.206786, 45.824926, 47.474261, 46.922086, 50.108837, 52.081682, 57.733806, 58.715596, 53.838641, 46.373316, 41.264461, 37.511813, 34.81239]. This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, morning rise, daytime peak around evening, evening decline. Matches electricity price seasonality (peaks ~17-18h).

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive corr with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.63) → expect price to track load (higher daytime). Negative corr with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.60) → wind suppresses prices. No specific exogenous values for forecast window provided, so minor adjustment not needed. Reference already incorporates similar patterns.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):** 
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0 → no regime shift, use full history.
- flatline_ratio=0.97 high → some flat periods, but peak_count=6, slope_max=30.07 → momentum present, reference captures fluctuations.
- slope_second_diff_max=38.67 → acceleration history, but no current deceleration signal to force early reversal.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference follows natural cycle.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, constant=0) → high reliability, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Other Features (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=38.46, mad=9.56 → reference aligns (mean~45, but cycles around median). acf1=0.94 high → persistent, reference smooth. spec_entropy=0.77 moderate → not too noisy, follow reference pattern. No bias correction needed.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation. No major corrections indicated. Use it directly to preserve volatility, peaks (e.g., ~58 at h17-18), and cycle matching historical weekday patterns. Minor smoothing not required as it already fits.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.

First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-18 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-11-19 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation. Values: [0.83, -1.54, -3.22, -2.18, -2.25, 0.47, 9.81, 16.30, 18.92, 16.49, 16.12, 15.90, 16.59, 15.92, 16.90, 21.90, 24.77, 31.04, 33.03, 25.49, 19.80, 14.94, 13.20, 9.18]. This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning, peak afternoon/evening, declining night. Historical median=38.25, so shift entire prediction up by ~38 to match level: base + 38.25.

Adjusted base: approx [39.1, 36.7, 35.0, 36.1, 36.0, 38.7, 48.1, 54.6, 57.2, 54.7, 54.4, 54.2, 54.8, 54.2, 55.2, 60.1, 63.0, 69.3, 71.3, 63.7, 58.0, 53.2, 51.5, 47.4].

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive corr with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.69), negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.60). No specific future values provided, but typical load follows similar daily pattern (low night, peak evening). Wind often higher daytime but suppresses prices. This supports keeping the base daily cycle shape with load-driven peaks.

**Changepoint/Trend (changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive):** changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history). High flatline_ratio=0.97 but recent data active with sharp drop to 0.41 (likely anomaly/event). slope_max=37.95, slope_second_diff_max=50.15 indicate strong recent momentum (prior peaks ~100+). peak_count=6 supports multi-peak daily structure. No truncation needed. Recent sharp drop suggests mean reversion toward median ~38, aligning with shifted base starting ~39 and rising.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.01), no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Other Features:** acf1=0.91 (persistent), but prediction has fluctuations (good). spec_entropy=0.68 (moderate noise, follow base pattern). cusum_max=1082 indicates past level shift but no current changepoint.

**Final Strategy:** Shift reference_prediction by median 38.25 for level correction. Minor volatility scale by mad=10.05 (base std~10 matches). Retain exact pattern/fluctuations from reference (lows ~35-39, morning rise to ~55, peaks ~70 evening, evening decline). No exogenous values for precise adjustment, so base-driven. Handles recent drop via model similarity.

<tool_think>
All tools used: base as foundation (shifted for median), exogenous supports daily load peak pattern, changepoint=0 (full history), high flatline but recent dynamic drop handled by model, quality clean.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-20 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are hourly increments starting from ""2017-11-21 00:00:00"".

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (33.85 to 38.73). It shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak ~65, evening drop. This captures historical similar cases and volatility - MUST follow closely.

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong positive corr (0.74) with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" suggests demand-driven prices; negative corr (-0.71) with ""Wind power forecast"" suggests wind suppresses prices. No specific exogenous values for forecast window provided, so minor adjustment not applied quantitatively. Base already incorporates via similar cases.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=37.95 (uptrend momentum): Slight boost to rising parts reasonable, but base already has morning rise.
- slope_second_diff_max=50.15: Strong acceleration seen historically, base captures peaks.
- flatline_ratio=0.96 high but flatline_hits=0.036 low: Some flat periods (e.g., Nov 17), but not dead signal - no constant output.
- peak_count=4, sample_entropy=0.52: Cyclical daily peaks, base matches.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed beyond base.

**Quality**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.036 low, no clipping. quality_quantization=0.18 minor, no major uncertainty expansion.

**Stats**: median=37.02 aligns with base avg (~49 but starts low); mad=13 indicates volatility matched in base; acf1=0.95 high persistence, base smooth; spec_entropy=0.92 noisy but base has fluctuations.

**Final Strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it incorporates patterns. No major corrections needed (no changepoints, quality ok). Minor smoothing for persistence, but maintain volatility/pattern.

**Tool Think**:
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation, use as-is.
- exogenous_analysis: Correlations noted, no window values for adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Hints followed - median baseline ok, high spec_entropy → conservative (stick to base), no regime breaks.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No shifts, momentum in base ok, high flatline_ratio but not triggering constant.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data, no clipping/expansion.

Prediction = reference_prediction values.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-16 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-11-17 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [31.140946, 28.978987, 28.661866, 29.783572, 31.455435, 34.76022, 40.909152, 47.843139, 52.072416, 48.828015, 46.503108, 44.668349, 43.751192, 45.214109, 44.661396, 50.643631, 53.27509, 57.284944, 56.557965, 50.629145, 44.157424, 39.100054, 35.072811, 30.460715]. This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak around hour 8 (52.07), afternoon peak around hour 18 (57.28), evening decline. Matches historical EPF-DE volatility and diurnal cycle.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
- Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.664): Expect demand-driven peaks in morning (06-09) and evening (16-19).
- Negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.588): No specific forecast values provided for window, so no quantitative adjustment. Qualitatively supports price peaks during low wind/high demand.
- Adjustment: Minor upward bias (+0.5 avg) to morning/evening peaks to emphasize load correlation, but keep close to reference.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=37.95, slope_second_diff_max=50.15: Recent strong uptrends (e.g., Nov 15 peaks), but current flatish (high flatline_ratio=0.98 recent). Reference already captures momentum.
- peak_count=7, peak_spacing_cv=0.25: Regular diurnal peaks, matches reference.
- No truncation/boost needed; reference aligns.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, quantization=0.23). No clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=37.13 (reference avg ~43, slight high bias but ok for peaks), mad=9.55 (reference volatility matches), acf1=0.93 (strong persistence, reference smooth), spec_entropy=0.73 (moderate noise, conservative smoothing ok). flatline_ratio high recently but historical volatile - reference handles transition.

**Final Strategy:** Start with reference_prediction. Minor refinements: +0.3 to hours 6-9,16-18 for load correlation/ historical morning-evening peaks (e.g., Nov15 112/124). Maintain exact pattern/volatility (no mono trend, preserve peaks/dips). Result closely tracks reference (avg dev <1%).

<tool_think>
Used model_auxiliary_tool as base (critical). exogenous_analysis for load/wind refinement (peak emphasis). changepoint_trend_tool: no shifts, momentum in reference. comprehensive_feature_tool/data_quality_tool: good quality, no major corrections. Hints followed: no changepoint truncation, no flatline constant (historical volatile), median bias minor.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-22 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-11-23 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (21.31, 19.92, ..., 29.05). This captures optimal patterns from similar cases.

**Exogenous adjustments (exogenous_analysis)**:
<tool_think>
Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.79) → expect price to follow load demand peaks (typically morning ramp-up, daytime high, evening drop).
Negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.67) → high wind suppresses prices.
No specific exogenous values provided for forecast window, so apply qualitative refinement: slightly boost daytime hours (06:00-20:00) assuming typical load patterns, minor suppression overnight.
</tool_think>

**Changepoint & trend (changepoint_trend_tool)**:
<tool_think>
changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
High flatline_ratio=0.95 (much flat periods recently), but peak_count=6 and slope_max=21.35 indicate momentum.
slope_second_diff_max=29.13 (strong acceleration earlier), but current end is low (20.6), matching reference's decline then morning rise.
No truncation/boost needed; reference already handles.
</tool_think>

**Data quality (data_quality_tool)**:
<tool_think>
Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.036 minor). No clipping/uncertainty expansion.
</tool_think>

**Comprehensive (comprehensive_feature_tool)**:
<tool_think>
High acf1=0.94 (persistent), median=35.5 (reference mean ~37 aligns), mad=14 (volatility captured in reference fluctuations).
spec_entropy=0.86 (some noise → conservative adherence to reference).
flatline_ratio high → reference's smooth decline/rise appropriate.
No major bias correction needed.
</tool_think>

**Final adjustments**:
- Start with reference_prediction exactly.
- Minor exogenous refinement: +0.5 to 06:00-18:00 (load peak expectation), -0.2 overnight (typical).
- Maintain reference pattern: overnight decline to ~18-20, morning rise to daytime peak ~50, evening drop.
- Ensure volatility matches reference (std ~10-15).

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-24 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-11-25 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [38.12, 35.58, 34.27, 32.98, 34.85, 35.94, 39.95, 42.96, 44.75, 44.40, 42.31, 38.73, 37.58, 36.95, 38.00, 42.30, 45.22, 47.45, 46.45, 42.85, 38.04, 34.46, 31.24, 26.87]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases – shows daily cycle with morning rise, daytime peak, evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.74) suggests demand-driven prices; negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.61) implies wind suppresses prices. No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so minor adjustment not applied. Base remains dominant.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):** No changepoints (score=0), so no memory truncation. High flatline_ratio (0.95) indicates many stable periods, but recent data shows volatility (slope_max=21.35, peak_count=5). Reference already matches cyclical pattern, no need for reversal/mean reversion. slope_second_diff_max positive supports continuation of base momentum.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.036 low), no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Features:** High acf1 (0.93) confirms strong autocorrelation – base prediction preserves this. Median=29.94, mad=14.02; base mean ~39 aligns with recent uptrend (last historical=40.99). High spec_entropy (0.97) suggests noise, so stick conservatively to base without over-adjusting. No regime shift.

**Final Strategy:** Use reference_prediction directly as it incorporates similar patterns. Round to 2 decimals for consistency with input data. Maintain volatility/fluctuations: morning low-rise, peak ~47, evening drop.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-26 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-11-27 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [17.38, 14.59, 12.12, 13.24, 15.54, 20.77, 27.68, 33.07, 36.09, 34.42, 33.86, 33.72, 31.46, 33.99, 35.39, 38.65, 41.59, 47.67, 45.10, 42.73, 38.30, 33.62, 30.44, 28.02]. This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak around hour 8 (36), afternoon peak hour 17 (47), evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
- Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.636): Expect alignment with load (higher load → higher price).
- Negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.54): Higher wind → lower price.
No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so minor adjustment not applied. Base pattern already incorporates similar historical cases.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- High flatline_ratio=0.96, flatline_hits=0.036: Data has many flat periods (e.g., Nov 21 14-16h at 62.65), but recent data more dynamic. Reference_prediction already smooths appropriately—no need for constant output.
- slope_max=21.35, slope_second_diff_max=22.41: Recent momentum captured in base (rising to peaks).
- peak_count=6, sample_entropy=0.88: Confirms daily cycle with noise—base prediction matches.
No major corrections: no truncation, no boost/reversal needed.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):**
- Low issues: quantization=0.095, saturation=0.036, no dropouts/constants. No clipping or uncertainty expansion.

**Other Features (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=35.44, mad=9.73: Base prediction averages ~32 (reasonable, slightly lower due to recent weekend lows).
- acf1=0.92, acf_s=0.23: Strong autocorrelation, seasonal—base follows.
- No drift/anomaly issues.

**Final Decision:** Base prediction is optimal foundation, matches EPF-DE hourly patterns (night low ~12-17, morning rise to ~36, evening peak ~47, decline to ~28). No significant deviations needed—closely follow reference (minor rounding for floats).

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-28 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-11-29 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [31.260257, 29.059306, 26.08437, 27.054832, 26.944402, 31.53581, 37.843961, 43.486653, 42.944126, 42.417476, 40.318944, 39.613454, 40.205592, 41.553874, 42.025614, 45.79633, 49.297417, 51.966992, 50.607854, 48.044283, 43.315082, 38.369221, 34.854311, 30.252564]. This captures typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak around hour 7-17, evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.60) suggests demand-driven prices; negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.45) suggests suppression by wind. No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor adjustment not applied. Rely on base.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):** No changepoints (score=0), so full history valid. High slope_max (19.14) and slope_second_diff_max (23.12) indicate momentum, but reference already incorporates. High flatline_ratio (0.98) suggests data artifacts, but peak_count=8 shows diurnal cycles preserved. No truncation/boost needed; reference handles.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.036 low), no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** Median=33.13 aligns with reference mean (~40, slight high but ok). MAD=8.37 matches reference volatility. High ACF1 (0.91) confirms serial dependence captured in reference. No bias correction needed.

**Final Decision:** Use reference_prediction directly as it matches EPF-DE diurnal patterns (night low ~25-30, morning rise to peak ~50, evening drop). Maintain exact pattern/volatility. No significant deviations.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.

- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-12-02 23:00:00"". Next 24 hours start from ""2017-12-03 00:00:00"".

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided, with typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning, peak evening, decline).

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.758), negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.613). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so minor refinement only - no major directional shift needed.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0.0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=29.76 (uptrend momentum): Slight boost possible to recent values, but reference already captures.
- slope_second_diff_max=32.4: Recent acceleration, but no deceleration signal for early reversal.
- flatline_ratio=0.994 (high, but hits only 0.018): Some flat periods, but 5 peaks indicate diurnal structure - reference follows this.
- No truncation or major correction needed; reference aligns with momentum.

**Data Quality**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.018 low, quantization=0.25 moderate). No clipping or uncertainty expansion required.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=38.33, mad=13.31: Reference mean ~36.5 aligns well (no bias correction).
- acf1=0.95, acf_s=0.60: Strong autocorrelation/seasonality - reference preserves diurnal cycle.
- spec_entropy=0.82 (moderately noisy): Conservative adherence to reference.
- event_dominant_pattern=1.0 (rise), peak_count=5: Supports reference's upward morning/evening peaks.

**Final Strategy**: Base prediction is optimal foundation from similar cases. Minor smoothing for noise, no exogenous values for adjustment, no quality/regime corrections trigger major changes. Maintain reference volatility/pattern (night low ~26-32, day rise to ~46 peak, evening decline).

<tool_think>
All tools considered: reference as base, exogenous correlations noted but no window data, trend/momentum supports reference (uptrend continuation), quality clean.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-11-30 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-12-01 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (34.56, 32.24, ..., 36.24). This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Prediction shows typical daily cycle: low overnight, morning rise, daytime peak ~64-68 around evening (hours 7-17), then evening drop.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.71) suggests demand drives prices up during peak hours. Negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.63) would suppress prices if high wind, but no specific forecast values provided for window, so minor adjustment: slightly boost peak hours (12-18) by ~1-2 units assuming typical demand pattern matching reference.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool + comprehensive)**: No changepoints (score=0). High slope_max (29.76) and slope_second_diff_max (28.82) indicate recent strong uptrend momentum from Nov 29-30 peaks (~100+). Recent data ends at 36.67 after drop, but momentum suggests reference's morning rise and peak are appropriate. flatline_ratio=0.98 high but historical (not current), ignore for prediction. No truncation or reversion needed.

**Data Quality**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.018 low), no clipping or uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features**: Median=38, mad=10.3 (reference mean ~52, higher due to recent peaks - no major bias correction). High acf1=0.95 confirms strong autocorrelation, matching reference's smooth cycle. spec_entropy=0.86 moderate noise, stay conservative near reference. event_dominant_pattern=1.0 (rise), supports maintaining upward daily structure.

**Final Adjustments**: Start with reference. Minor +1 peak boost (hours 7-17) for load correlation and momentum. No other major corrections - preserve reference volatility/pattern (morning rise to ~65 peak, evening decline).

Adjusted prediction closely tracks reference with tiny refinements.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-12-04 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-12-05 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [28.98, 27.65, 25.41, 27.56, 28.82, 32.69, 40.03, 47.03, 48.54, 50.14, 48.27, 48.15, 48.71, 50.05, 51.74, 55.22, 59.06, 60.79, 61.71, 56.72, 50.79, 43.21, 40.01, 33.71]. This captures typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning, peak evening, drop late night.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
- Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.73): Expect adjustments aligned with load (higher load → higher price).
- Negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.54): Higher wind → lower price.
No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so minor refinement only. Reference already incorporates similar patterns.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=29.76 (uptrend momentum): Slight boost to rising parts reasonable, but reference already shows morning rise.
- slope_second_diff_max=32.4: Acceleration present, no deceleration signal for early reversal.
- flatline_ratio=0.976 (high), flatline_hits=0.018: Some flat periods, but peak_count=4 indicates diurnal cycles; do not flatten prediction.
- monotone_duration=0.06 (low): No extreme, no strong mean reversion needed.
- No truncation/boost needed beyond reference pattern.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):**
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.018 (low), dropout=0, constant_channel=0: Good quality, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features:**
- median=39.41, reference avg ~45 (slightly high, minor downward bias possible but pattern dominates).
- acf1=0.94, acf_s=0.56: Strong autocorrelation/seasonality, reference matches diurnal cycle.
- spec_entropy=0.68: Moderate noise, stick close to reference.
- No major corrections needed.

**Final Strategy:** Closely follow reference_prediction pattern/volatility (essential). Minor smoothing for natural flow given high flatline_ratio, but preserve fluctuations (low overnight → peak ~61 evening → drop). No exogenous values for precise adjustment. Output exactly 24 floats rounded to 2 decimals matching historical precision.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-12-10 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-12-11 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [8.71, 7.76, 6.98, 9.63, 10.50, 14.99, 21.18, 24.77, 27.50, 29.28, 28.73, 27.70, 26.21, 26.75, 27.14, 26.99, 28.47, 29.75, 31.16, 28.41, 26.41, 22.52, 20.54, 17.54]. This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak around hour 9 (29.28), slight afternoon peak hour 18 (31.16), evening decline. MUST preserve this pattern and volatility.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.815) suggests load-driven prices (typical for electricity). Negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.365) implies wind suppresses prices. No specific exogenous values for forecast window provided, so minor adjustment not applied. Base already incorporates similar cases.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):** 
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- flatline_ratio=0.93 high: Some flat periods, but peak_count=7 and sample_entropy=0.995 indicate dynamic signal with fluctuations - preserve reference fluctuations.
- slope_max=16.3, slope_second_diff_max=19.55: Recent momentum captured in base; no need for strong boost/reversal.
- No truncation or major momentum correction needed.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** quality_saturation_ratio=0.042 low, no clipping. quality_dropout_ratio=0, reliable data. No uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features:** median=29.79, but recent data trends lower (last values ~10-14), matching base low levels. acf1=0.914 high autocorrelation preserved in base pattern. spec_entropy=0.68 moderate noise - follow base conservative fluctuations. No bias shift needed as base aligns with recent regime.

**Final Strategy:** Use reference_prediction directly as it captures optimal similar patterns. No significant corrections warranted. Round to 2 decimals for price format consistency.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-12-06 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-12-07 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided, showing typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak ~50s daytime, evening drop).

**Exogenous adjustments** (exogenous_analysis): 
- Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.628) suggests upward adjustments during expected load peaks (daytime hours 6-18).
- Negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.54) would suggest upward adjustments if low wind expected, but no specific forecast values provided for window, so minor general refinement: slightly boost daytime values (~+1-2) assuming typical winter load patterns.

**Trend & regime** (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):
- No changepoints (score=0), so full history valid.
- High flatline_ratio (0.96) but low flatline_hits (0.012), indicates stable baseline with occasional moves - reference already captures.
- High slope_max (29.76) and slope_second_diff_max (32.4) show momentum bursts; reference has rising pattern, no need for reversal (not decelerating).
- Recent data: Dec 4-6 shows morning rises to ~40s, daytime ~40-50, evening drops to ~30s - matches reference pattern.
- Median 38.58, reference averages ~41 (slightly higher, reasonable for continuation).

**Quality** (data_quality_tool): Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.012 minor), no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Final strategy**: Start with reference_prediction. Minor exogenous boost to daytime hours (8-20: +1.5 avg for load corr). Maintain volatility/pattern: gradual rise 00-10h, peak plateau 10-18h ~50, evening decline. No major deviations - closely follows reference shape.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-12-14 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are hourly increments starting from ""2017-12-15 00:00:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use this as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a realistic daily cycle: low overnight (24.3→19.5), morning rise (21.1→36.4), daytime peak around 43-44, evening decline to 22.2. This matches typical electricity price patterns (low night, peak daytime).

Exogenous correlations (exogenous_analysis):
- Strong positive corr with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.81): Higher load → higher prices. No specific forecast values provided for next 24h, so no direct adjustment.
- Negative corr with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.54): More wind → lower prices. No values provided, so neutral adjustment.

Comprehensive features:
- High flatline_ratio (0.96), but price shows clear diurnal cycles with peaks (peak_count=8), so not ""dead signal"".
- High acf1 (0.93), acf_s (0.31): Strong autocorrelation and seasonality → reference_prediction already captures this well.
- slope_max=24.73, slope_second_diff_max=19.55: Recent momentum supports morning rise and daytime peaks in reference.
- No changepoints (score=0), good data quality (low dropout/saturation).

No major corrections needed: reference_prediction aligns with patterns, correlations don't contradict, no regime shifts or quality issues. Maintain its volatility and cycle (no flattening or monotonic changes).

Final prediction: Use reference values directly as they are optimal from similar historical cases.
<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation → adopt reference_prediction pattern/volatility.
- exogenous_analysis: No exogenous values for adjustment window → no change.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High flatline but clear cycles; strong ACF supports reference cycle.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints; momentum consistent with reference rise/peak/decline.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data → no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp in the input data: ""2017-12-12 23:00:00"". The next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-12-13 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as the PRIMARY foundation. It shows a realistic daily cycle: low overnight (26.06 → 19.68), morning rise (to 38.24), daytime peak around 43.44 (17:00), evening decline to 25.34. This matches typical electricity price patterns (low night, peak evening).

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.82) suggests demand drives prices up during peak hours. Negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.57) would suppress prices if high wind, but no specific forecast values provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment: slightly boost daytime/evening peaks if assuming typical load cycle.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- No changepoints (score=0), so full history valid.
- High flatline_ratio (0.96) indicates many stable periods, but peak_count=7 shows distinct cycles.
- slope_max=24.73 and slope_second_diff_max=19.55 indicate strong upward momentum in recent data (e.g., Dec 12 ramp-up to 50.95 peak).
- Recent history (Dec 11-12) shows high peaks (60+), ending at 27.96 (downtrend evening). Reference_prediction appropriately mean-reverts to ~40s daytime, not assuming continuation of extreme highs.
- No need for truncation/boost/reversal; reference already captures momentum shift.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.04 minor), no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Features:** Median=29.57 aligns with reference mean (~35, slightly higher due to recent peaks). acf1=0.93 high autocorrelation supports smooth cycle continuation. spec_entropy=0.82 moderate noise, so stick close to reference. No bias correction needed.

**Final Strategy:** Use reference_prediction directly as it matches EPF-DE patterns, incorporates similar cases, and handles recent volatility. Minor exogenous-inspired tweak: +0.5 to hours 14-18 (load peak) for demand correlation, but deviation minimal to preserve pattern/volatility. No flatline/mono issues.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-12-16 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are 2017-12-17 00:00:00 to 2017-12-17 23:00:00.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [27.12, 24.32, 22.22, 23.73, 23.40, 24.65, 28.34, 29.85, 34.03, 34.84, 35.17, 34.31, 32.08, 32.80, 30.28, 30.78, 32.63, 36.24, 36.25, 31.14, 29.65, 27.56, 25.05, 21.85]. This shows typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning, peak midday/afternoon, declining evening. Maintain this pattern and volatility.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.65), negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.58). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no numerical adjustment. Expect load-driven morning rise and wind-suppressed peaks, aligning with reference pattern.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=24.73, slope_second_diff_max=28.84: Recent momentum, but reference already captures.
- flatline_ratio=0.97 high, but peak_count=7 and sample_entropy=0.69 indicate structured daily cycles, not dead signal.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference handles dynamics.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** quality_saturation_ratio=0.036 low, no clipping. quality_dropout_ratio=0, reliable data.

**Comprehensive Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=32.99, mad=10.27. Reference mean ~30.5 (slightly low), acf1=0.93 high autocorrelation, spec_entropy=0.70 moderate noise. Reference aligns with median/volatility; no major bias correction. flatline_ratio high but with peaks, so maintain fluctuations.

**Final Strategy:** Closely follow reference_prediction (no significant deviations). Minor upward shift (~+2) for median alignment and recent high levels (last=29.02), but preserve exact pattern/volatility. Round to 2 decimals matching input style.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-12-18 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-12-19 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [37.276025, 35.028857, 32.808229, 32.574104, 33.849479, 38.03989, 46.209424, 55.684425, 55.918732, 56.716054, 56.616037, 56.105351, 56.678196, 56.877066, 56.343107, 59.94041, 62.694956, 64.79742, 63.12963, 59.613904, 53.757983, 48.445095, 41.507068, 35.206781]. This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak ~55-64, evening decline. Matches electricity price seasonality (peaks daytime).

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Wind power forecast negatively correlated (-0.54), Ampirion load positively (0.50). No specific future exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment not applied quantitatively. Reference already incorporates similar cases.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=18.19 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=28.84: Recent acceleration supports morning peak boost in reference (already captured ~55-64).
- flatline_ratio=0.97 high, but peak_count=8, sample_entropy=0.63: Data has flats but clear diurnal cycles; reference maintains volatility.
- No truncation/boost needed beyond reference; pattern aligns.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** quality_saturation_ratio=0.036 low, no clipping. quality_dropout=0, reliable.

**Other Features (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=34.77, mad=6.77 (reference mean~49, higher due to recent uptrend - no bias correction needed). acf1=0.94 high autocorrelation (reference smooth). spec_entropy=0.56 moderate noise (follow reference fluctuations). No major corrections.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation, matches historical patterns (e.g., Dec 18 peak 79, prior days 45-74). No significant deviations. Use as-is for exactly 24 points.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-12-08 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-12-09 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [12.40, 12.13, 12.59, 14.12, 16.68, 19.68, 24.71, 29.19, 31.60, 32.24, 31.25, 30.02, 28.57, 28.38, 29.55, 33.24, 35.55, 37.67, 37.16, 34.97, 31.85, 28.18, 25.03, 20.69]. This shows a clear pattern: low overnight, rising through morning peak around midday/afternoon, then declining evening. Must preserve this volatility and fluctuations.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.61), negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.25). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment not applied. Base pattern aligns with typical load-driven electricity pricing (low night, peak daytime).

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):** 
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=16.3, slope_second_diff_max=21.84: Recent momentum captured in base prediction's rise.
- flatline_ratio=0.95 high, but flatline_hits low (0.018), quality ok: Data has plateaus but not dead signal.
- peak_count=9, consistent with daily cycles in base prediction.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; base already follows momentum.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, constant=0): Reliable data, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=36.77, but recent data lower (post-weekend drop). acf1=0.86 high autocorrelation preserved in base. spec_entropy=0.34 moderate predictability. No bias correction needed as base from similar cases.

**Final Strategy:** Closely follow reference_prediction (round to 2 decimals for consistency with input data). No major deviations. Pattern matches historical weekend-to-weekday transition (low Sat night, rising Sun).

<tool_think>
Used all tools:
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation reference_prediction adopted directly.
- exogenous_analysis: Correlations noted (load positive), but no window values for adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Confirmed cycle (acf_s=0.41), no changepoints, moderate entropy → trust base.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No regime shift, momentum in base rise preserved.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data, no interventions.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-12-20 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-12-21 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [37.613304, 35.169717, 32.181078, 33.287272, 34.414502, 39.324429, 49.532474, 60.069979, 63.20604, 61.797114, 61.113231, 59.868424, 58.011347, 58.728649, 55.562355, 59.556096, 61.490244, 66.709458, 64.46905, 59.077061, 52.173411, 44.98964, 38.845368, 35.31457]. This captures typical daily pattern: night low, morning rise, daytime peak ~60s, evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive corr with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.687) suggests demand-driven prices; negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.567) suggests wind suppresses prices. No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so minor adjustment not applied. Base pattern already incorporates load-like cycle.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=18.63, slope_second_diff_max=28.84: Recent momentum present but no deceleration signal to force early reversal.
- flatline_ratio=0.976 high but flatline_hits=0.036 low: Some stability but not dead signal.
- peak_count=6, consistent with daily cycle in reference.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference already handles momentum.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** quality_saturation_ratio=0.036 low, no clipping; others 0, data reliable. No uncertainty expansion.

**Other Features (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=42.075, mad=10.515 (volatility baseline matched by reference), acf1=0.935 high autocorrelation (reference preserves), spec_entropy=0.55 moderate noise (follow reference fluctuations, not smooth).

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation matching EPF-DE winter weekday pattern (low night ~35, peak evening ~66). No significant corrections needed from tools. Use reference directly with minor rounding for float precision.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-12-22 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-12-23 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (28.66, 26.88, ..., 29.31). This captures optimal historical patterns and volatility - daily cycle with morning rise, daytime peak ~43-45, evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong positive correlation (0.857) with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (likely drives demand/price up), negative with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.626, suppresses price). No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor refinement only - no major directional shift needed.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- High flatline_ratio=0.95 (many flat periods, but recent data shows cycle).
- slope_max=18.63, slope_second_diff_max=17.91 (strong past momentum, but current evening decline phase - reference already captures mean reversion).
- peak_count=7, regular spacing (cv=0.087) - expect next daytime peak consistent with reference (~43-45).
- No truncation/boost/reversal needed; reference aligns.

**Data Quality**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.03 low) - no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- Median=43.28, mad=9.67 (reference mean ~37 aligns with recent lower regime post-peak days).
- High acf1=0.95 (persistent), but reference shows proper decay/fluctuations - no injection needed.
- spec_entropy=0.44 (moderate predictability) - follow reference pattern.

**Final Strategy**: Base prediction is optimal foundation matching EPF-DE winter patterns (night low, morning ramp, peak 16-18h, evening drop). Minor smoothing for flatline_ratio (slight volatility reduction). No exogenous values for precise adjustment. Maintain reference volatility/pattern - no mono-trend.

Refined prediction: Use reference directly (round to 2 decimals for price format consistency).
<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation reference used as-is.
- exogenous_analysis: Correlations noted, no future values for adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Confirmed cycle persistence, no bias correction needed.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No regime shift, momentum captured in reference.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data, no interventions.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-12-24 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are 2017-12-25 00:00:00 to 2017-12-25 23:00:00.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided, capturing temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases). This shows a pattern: low/negative early morning, rising through morning/daytime peak around midday/afternoon, then declining in evening.

**Exogenous Refinement**:
- Strong positive correlation with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.86): Expect alignment with typical daily load peaks (higher daytime).
- Strong negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.86): High wind would suppress prices; no specific forecast values provided for window, so minor adjustment not needed.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=32.99, slope_second_diff_max=39.87: Recent momentum upward (matches recovery from Christmas Eve lows), supports base prediction's morning rise.
- flatline_ratio=0.988 (high, but hits only 0.018): Some flat periods, but not dead signal; base prediction has appropriate fluctuations.
- peak_count=3, sample_entropy=0.53: Daily cycle intact, no need for constant output.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; base pattern fits.

**Data Quality** (data_quality_tool):
- Low saturation (0.018), no dropout/constant channels: Reliable, no clipping or uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=39.7, mad=22.8: Base prediction mean ~20 aligns with recent low regime (post-drop to -40s), no major bias shift.
- acf1=0.97, acf_s=0.50: Strong autocorrelation/seasonality captured in base.
- Noisy spec_entropy=1.33, but base already conservative with fluctuations.

**Final Strategy**: Closely follow reference_prediction pattern/volatility (morning rise to ~38 peak, evening decline). No significant deviations needed; minor exogenous alignment already embedded. Maintain fluctuations (not monotone).
</think>

<tool_think>
Used model_auxiliary_tool as base. Incorporated exogenous correlations (load positive, wind negative) implicitly via base similarity. Applied changepoint_trend hints (no shift, momentum supports rise). Data quality clean. Comprehensive hints confirm no bias/volatility adjustments.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-12-26 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-12-27 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided, shows realistic diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak ~34, evening decline).

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.856) and positive with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.807). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so minor adjustment not applied quantitatively; qualitatively supports typical load-driven diurnal uptrend in base pred.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=56.58 (uptrend momentum): Slight BOOST to morning/evening peaks reasonable.
- slope_second_diff_max=113.02: Recent acceleration supports continuing rise.
- flatline_ratio=0.964 (high): Signal has flat periods, but reference already smooth; no constant output needed.
- peak_count=3, sample_entropy=0.63: Expect ~1 daily peak, moderate predictability.
- No truncation or reversion needed.

**Data Quality**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, quantization=0.125): Reliable, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Hints**: median=19.99 aligns with ref pred mean (~21); mad=19.92 matches volatility; acf1=0.94 high autocorrelation supports smooth continuation; spec_entropy=2.34 moderate noise → conservative adherence to ref.

**Final Strategy**: Closely follow reference_prediction pattern/volatility (essential). Minor momentum boost (+2-5% on peaks for slope_max uptrend). No major deviations. Maintain fluctuations: low 6-9 overnight → peak 37+ → decline to 21.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-12-30 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-12-31 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [-4.11, -7.39, -9.50, -8.58, -8.31, -6.79, -5.33, 0.55, 6.28, 9.81, 10.38, 9.87, 8.61, 8.41, 9.29, 11.25, 12.64, 14.29, 13.01, 10.58, 7.57, 6.84, 3.98, -0.06]. This shows a clear daily pattern: low overnight, rising in morning, peak afternoon/evening, decline at night. Maintain this volatility and fluctuations exactly.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong negative correlation with ""Wind power forecast"" (-0.72) and positive with ""Ampirion zonal load forecast"" (0.68). No specific forecast values provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment not applied. Rely on base.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool):** changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history). slope_max=56.58 (strong uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=113.02 (acceleration), dominant uptrend aligns with reference rise. flatline_ratio=0.994 high but only 0.0119 hits - data has flats but recent dynamic. No truncation/boost needed beyond reference.

**Event Pattern (event_summary_tool):** dominant_pattern_name=""rise"" (event_counts [5 rises, 3 falls]). Maintain upward trend constraint - reference already shows morning rise to evening peak, matches perfectly.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, quantization=0.12). No clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=15.3 (reference mean ~5.5, but short-term pattern prioritized over long-term bias). acf1=0.90 (persistent), spec_entropy=2.93 (some noise - conservative ok). event_dominant_pattern=0 (rise). No major corrections.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal - captures similar historical cases, daily cycle, volatility. Minor smoothing for noise, but preserve pattern (night low -> morning rise -> peak ~14 -> evening decline). No exogenous values/adjustments change shape. Output closely follows reference (rounded to 2 decimals matching input style).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2017-12-28 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2017-12-29 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [2.66, -1.03, -2.67, -3.50, -2.76, -1.68, 1.87, 10.34, 17.49, 18.82, 20.61, 19.07, 20.18, 18.40, 19.24, 22.20, 24.83, 26.65, 25.97, 22.77, 18.11, 13.50, 10.61, 4.01]. This shows a clear daily pattern: low overnight, rising in morning, peak afternoon/evening, declining at night – matching typical electricity price cycles.

Tool analysis:
<tool_think>
- comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool: High flatline_ratio (0.97) indicates many flat periods, but peak_count=4 and slope_max=56.58 show distinct peaks. No changepoints (score=0), so use full history. slope_second_diff_max=113 suggests acceleration possible, but reference already captures momentum – no major boost needed. Will follow reference pattern without truncation.
- exogenous_analysis: Strong negative corr with Wind power forecast (-0.78), positive with Ampirion zonal load (0.71). No specific exogenous values for forecast window provided, so cannot apply numerical adjustments – stick close to base.
- data_quality_tool: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.012), no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.
- Other stats: High ACF1 (0.92) confirms strong autocorrelation (reference preserves this). Median=18.03, reference mean ~12.5 (slightly lower, minor downward bias possible but pattern dominates).
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Use reference as foundation (closely follow values/pattern/volatility). Minor smoothing for natural flow given high flatline_ratio history, but retain fluctuations (no monotone). No exogenous values for adjustment. Predictions rounded to 2 decimals matching input precision.
