### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-09 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-10 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [33.90, 30.20, 25.22, 22.89, 20.90, 22.34, 24.95, 29.26, 30.68, 32.22, 32.17, 31.71, 30.11, 28.34, 25.90, 24.74, 24.91, 27.74, 31.08, 34.34, 35.81, 34.57, 32.19, 30.20]. This captures typical diurnal pattern: night low, morning rise, daytime peak, evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlations (Gen forecast 0.89, System load 0.78). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment needed. Maintain base pattern as it likely incorporates these.

**Changepoint/Trend (changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive):** 
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=12.64 (positive momentum), slope_second_diff_max=20.72: Recent uptrend acceleration, but base already shows morning rise (h6-h10 increasing), so minor boost to morning hours (+0.5 avg) for momentum.
- flatline_ratio=0.96 high but flatline_hits=0.018 low: Minor flat periods, not dead signal.
- peak_count=8, peak_spacing_cv=0.33: Regular daily peaks, base matches.
No major truncation/boost/reversion needed; base aligns.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, constant=0): High quality data, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Stats:** median=35.46 (base avg ~29.7, slight low bias but pattern priority), mad=8.58 (base volatility matches), acf1=0.92 high autocorrelation (base preserves), spec_entropy=0.32 low (predictable signal). No bias correction needed as pattern > level.

**Final Decision:** Use reference_prediction as foundation (closely follow pattern/volatility). Minor morning momentum boost (+0.3 to +0.7 for h6-h10 to reflect slope_max). No other changes: maintains fluctuations, diurnal cycle matching historical (night ~20-30, day ~30-35, peaks ~35).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-13 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-14 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a typical daily electricity price pattern: low overnight (around 23-31), rising in morning (to 34-46), peak daytime (40-48), evening high (48+), then decline. This matches historical patterns in the data (e.g., peaks around 17:00-20:00).

**Exogenous Analysis:** High correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.91) and ""System load forecast"" (0.77). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment. Assume reference_prediction already incorporates similar historical exogenous patterns.

**Comprehensive Features & Changepoint/Trend:**
- No changepoints (score=0), so use full history.
- High flatline_ratio (0.97) but low flatline_hits (0.012), minor data artifacts, not invalidating signal.
- slope_max=11.39 (recent uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=10.85 (acceleration), peak_count=9: Suggests continuing daily cycle with morning rise and evening peak, as in reference.
- acf1=0.92, acf_s=0.45: Strong autocorrelation and seasonality, reference already captures.
- median=35.45, mad=8.53: Reference mean ~39 aligns reasonably (slight upward bias expected in uptrend).
- Data quality good (low saturation/dropout).

**No major corrections needed:** Reference_prediction is optimal base. Minor bias correction: recent data shows evening peaks ~46-57, reference peaks ~48 align. Maintain volatility (std ~7-8 matching mad). No regime shift, momentum supports reference pattern.

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction directly, as it best captures pattern, volatility, and historical similarity.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-19 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-20 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [36.254825, 31.675838, 28.481522, 26.257047, 25.562168, 28.896455, 35.903628, 44.336189, 47.937577, 49.180268, 48.671658, 47.67467, 46.90797, 45.34943, 44.531689, 44.575001, 43.946097, 45.489267, 47.097694, 48.698457, 48.461865, 46.065722, 42.867208, 39.146582]. This captures typical daily electricity price pattern: low overnight, peak daytime, evening drop.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** High correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.88) and ""System load forecast"" (0.87). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment. Base pattern already incorporates similar historical cases with these factors.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):** 
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=13.17, slope_second_diff_max=13.39: Positive momentum, but reference already shows morning ramp-up.
- flatline_ratio=0.92 high: Some flat periods, but 8 peaks detected, sample_entropy=0.77 indicates predictable daily cycle. No need for constant output.
- No truncation or reversal needed; reference follows diurnal cycle.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** quality_saturation_ratio=0.018 low, dropout=0, quantization=0.11 acceptable. No clipping or uncertainty expansion.

**Other Features (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=37.74, mad=7.60 aligns with reference mean/volatility. acf1=0.91, acf_s=0.60 confirm strong daily seasonality matched by reference. spec_entropy=0.29 low (predictable). No bias correction needed.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal - closely follows historical diurnal pattern (night low ~25-36, morning rise, daytime peak ~45-49, evening drop). Minor smoothing for flatline_ratio but maintain fluctuations. No major deviations.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-07 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are hourly increments starting from ""2016-09-08 00:00:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [32.33, 28.11, 24.36, 22.86, 22.53, 26.43, 31.96, 39.52, 44.08, 47.13, 47.55, 47.27, 45.41, 44.25, 43.12, 41.43, 42.15, 43.60, 45.89, 48.12, 47.45, 45.67, 40.67, 36.60]. This captures typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak, afternoon dip, evening peak, late drop.

<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: High correlations (Gen forecast 0.94, System load 0.86) suggest base prediction already incorporates these via similar cases. No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment needed.

**comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool**:
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=12.64 (positive momentum), slope_second_diff_max=20.72: Recent uptrend acceleration, but reference already shows morning rise - minor boost not needed as pattern matches.
- flatline_ratio=0.946 high but flatline_hits=0.018 low: Some stability but not dead signal.
- peak_count=7, peak_spacing_cv=0.30: Regular daily peaks, reference matches diurnal cycle.
- acf1=0.92 high (persistent), spec_entropy=0.31 low (predictable signal): Reference suitable, no need for smoothing or noise injection.
- sample_entropy=0.86: Moderate complexity, follow reference fluctuations.

**data_quality_tool**: All quality metrics low (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, quantization=0.089): High reliability, no clipping or uncertainty expansion.

Overall: Data quality good, no major corrections. Reference prediction aligns with strong autocorrelation, diurnal pattern in historical data (night lows ~20-30, day peaks ~45-50), and tool signals.
</tool_think>

Final prediction uses reference values directly (rounded to 2 decimals for consistency with input), maintaining exact pattern/volatility: overnight drop, morning rise to peak, afternoon hold/slight dip, evening peak, night drop.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-21 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-22 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool**: Use as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. The reference_prediction array provides the core pattern: starts at ~36.9 (night low), rises to morning peak ~50.4 around hour 10, then gradually declines to ~41.1. This captures typical diurnal electricity price cycle (low night, peak daytime, evening drop).

**Tool analysis for refinements**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.89) and ""System load forecast"" (0.88). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment possible. Assume base model already incorporates similar historical exogenous patterns.

**comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool**:
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=14.48, slope_second_diff_max=13.39: Recent momentum present but not extreme; no need for strong linear boost or reversal prediction.
- flatline_ratio=0.89 high: Some flat periods, but peak_count=8 and sample_entropy=0.72 indicate diurnal cycles intact; no dead signal.
- acf1=0.91, acf_s=0.58: Strong autocorrelation and seasonality; reference_prediction already matches this diurnal pattern.
- median=38.49, mad=7.26: Reference mean ~43 aligns reasonably (slight upward bias expected for daytime forecast); no major shift needed.
- data_quality_tool: All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.02); high reliability, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

No major corrections needed: reference_prediction fits historical patterns (night lows ~20-30, day peaks ~45-50, evening ~40-45).
</tool_think>

**Final prediction**: Use reference_prediction directly as it captures volatility, diurnal cycle, and historical similarity. Minor rounding to 2 decimals for price realism, but preserve exact pattern/fluctuations.
</think>

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-17 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-18 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [30.27, 26.52, 23.09, 20.78, 18.35, 18.32, 20.17, 23.14, 25.62, 26.92, 26.98, 27.03, 26.27, 25.34, 24.64, 23.15, 24.00, 27.79, 33.16, 37.22, 38.69, 38.00, 35.90, 33.43]. This captures typical diurnal pattern: night low ~20s, morning rise, daytime peak ~38, evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** High correlations (Gen forecast 0.90, System load 0.86). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment. Pattern aligns with load-driven electricity prices.

**Changepoint/Trend (changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive):** 
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=13.17, slope_second_diff_max=13.39: Recent momentum, but reference already incorporates.
- flatline_ratio=0.92 high, but flatline_hits=0.012 low, quality ok: Minor data artifacts, no invalidation.
- peak_count=7, regular spacing (cv=0.17): Reference diurnal peaks match.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, constant=0): Reliable data, no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Stats:** median=36.92 (reference avg~28.7 lower, but recent data declining to 34.66, so ok), mad=8.94 (reference volatility matches), acf1=0.92 strong autocorrelation (reference preserves), spec_entropy=0.31 predictable signal.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation matching diurnal cycle, recent decline from daytime highs to night ~34, and tool diagnostics. No major corrections needed: low changepoints, good quality, strong autocorrelation preserved. Minor rounding for float precision.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### basic_statistics_tool
- Description: Advanced statistics tool (LEVEL & SCALE): Extracts ~10 core statistical features including median, MAD, ACF, spectral entropy, CUSUM, quantile kurtosis. Use for: (1) Bias Correction - if median differs from model prediction, shift prediction curve; (2) Confidence Interval - if MAD is high, expand uncertainty bounds; (3) Periodicity Injection - if acf_s is high but model output is flat, add periodic fluctuations; (4) Predictability Gate - if spec_entropy is high (noisy), use conservative strategy.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-03 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-04 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [30.210851, 27.810716, 23.755505, 21.557673, 19.004755, 18.785588, 19.619103, 20.917549, 21.929283, 23.628283, 23.963437, 24.740849, 24.279899, 24.297343, 23.99575, 22.011849, 21.571823, 23.560202, 27.292042, 30.970156, 33.216159, 35.11402, 34.860509, 33.106711]. This captures typical daily electricity price pattern: night low, morning rise, daytime peak, evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** High correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.90) and ""System load forecast"" (0.83). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment. Electricity prices typically follow load patterns (low at night, peak afternoon/evening), which aligns with reference pattern.

**Statistical Baseline (basic_statistics_tool):**
- Median 38.015, historical mean level ~38. Reference starts lower but rises toward median - no major bias correction needed.
- MAD 7.26 indicates moderate volatility - reference shows realistic fluctuations matching this.
- High ACF1 (0.91) confirms strong persistence, captured in reference.
- Low spec_entropy (0.27) = predictable signal, supports using reference directly.
- No need for periodicity injection (acf_s 0.47 moderate, reference already fluctuates).

**Trend & Regime (changepoint_trend_tool):**
- No changepoints (score=0), use full history.
- High flatline_ratio (0.92) but low flatline_hits (0.01), minor data artifacts - no invalidation.
- slope_max 10.13, slope_second_diff_max 13.23 indicate momentum captured in reference's rises/falls.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low saturation (0.01), no dropout/constant issues - data reliable, no clipping/amplification.

**Comprehensive (comprehensive_feature_tool):** Confirms no regime shifts, moderate volatility, predictable signal. event_dominant_pattern=1.0 suggests continuation of recent patterns (night low to day peak), matching reference.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation with realistic volatility/patterns matching diagnostics. Minor smoothing for natural flow, but preserve fluctuations (no monotone). No major corrections needed.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp from input: ""2016-09-11 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are hourly increments starting from ""2016-09-12 00:00:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the PRIMARY foundation: [29.079346, 25.939298, ..., 35.98132]. This captures optimal patterns from similar cases, with clear daily cycle (night low ~22-25, morning rise, daytime peak ~47, evening decline).

Key diagnostics:
- **basic_statistics_tool**: Median 35.03 (reference mean ~37.5, minor positive bias - slight downward shift possible but minimal). MAD 8.76 (moderate vol), acf_s 0.626 (strong seasonality - reference already captures), spec_entropy 0.30 (predictable signal - trust reference).
- **changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score 0). High flatline_ratio 0.96 but recent data shows peaks/valleys (e.g., 2016-09-11 evening peak 42.57). slope_max 10.4 indicates momentum captured in reference. No truncation/boost/reversion needed.
- **data_quality_tool**: Clean data (no dropouts/saturation issues).
- **exogenous_analysis**: Strong correlations (Gen forecast 0.88, Load 0.77) but no forward exogenous values provided - cannot adjust specifically.
- **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Confirms strong autocorrelation (acf1 0.92), daily pattern dominant.

No major corrections needed: reference_prediction already aligns with stats (volatility matches MAD), seasonality, and quality. Minor bias correction: shift down by ~2 (median diff) but preserve exact pattern/volatility as instructed. Final prediction uses reference directly (closely follows required).

<tool_think>
Used model_auxiliary_tool as foundation (no deviation). basic_statistics_tool: minor bias noted but reference trusted. changepoint_trend_tool: no regime shift. Others confirmatory.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-05 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-06 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [35.96919, 32.037173, 28.158158, 25.54241, 25.848408, 29.134938, 35.117263, 43.636876, 47.109093, 50.100993, 49.734849, 48.892631, 47.719517, 46.446056, 45.106679, 43.60887, 43.389259, 45.509796, 47.866306, 49.688966, 48.965936, 47.410349, 43.321563, 39.247341]. This captures typical daily electricity price pattern: night low, morning rise, daytime peak ~50, evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** High correlations (Generation forecast: 0.939, System load forecast: 0.847). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment. Reference already incorporates similar historical cases with these factors.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):** 
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=12.64 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=20.72: Recent acceleration supports morning rise to peak in reference.
- flatline_ratio=0.93 high but flatline_hits=0.018 low: Minor flats, not dead signal.
- peak_count=7, peak_spacing_cv=0.27: Regular daily peaks, reference matches.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference aligns.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, quantization=0.095). No clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=37.86, mad=7.86, acf1=0.92 (strong persistence), spec_entropy=0.30 (predictable). Reference mean ~42 aligns with recent uptrend from Sep 3-5 lows to Sep 5 peak ~54.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal - matches daily cycle, volatility, recent uptrend momentum, and tool diagnostics. No significant corrections needed. Use directly with minor rounding for float precision.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-15 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-16 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION: [34.60, 31.07, 27.88, 25.49, 25.24, 27.89, 35.04, 42.57, 46.78, 47.94, 46.85, 45.77, 43.88, 42.11, 40.38, 39.46, 39.68, 41.70, 44.47, 47.01, 46.18, 43.43, 40.66, 37.67]. This captures typical daily electricity price patterns: low overnight, peak daytime (08:00-20:00), evening drop. My prediction must closely follow this pattern and volatility.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** High correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.91) and ""System load forecast"" (0.83). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Electricity prices typically follow load/generation diurnal cycles, which the reference already embodies. No major shift needed.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=13.17 (positive momentum), slope_second_diff_max=10.74: Recent uptrend acceleration, but reference already shows morning ramp-up (35→42→47), so minor boost to early peaks reasonable.
- flatline_ratio=0.93 high, but flatline_hits=0.024 low, quality ok: Some stability but not dead signal.
- peak_count=8, peak_spacing_cv=0.24 (regular): Reference has regular daily peaks, preserve.
- No truncation or reversion needed.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.024, quantization=0.10). No clipping or uncertainty expansion.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=36.85, mad=8.85, acf1=0.92 (strong autocorrelation), spec_entropy=0.30 (predictable). Reference aligns with median level. event_dominant_pattern=1.0 (likely rise/fall cycle), matches reference.

**Final Decision:** Start with reference_prediction (rounded appropriately). Minor +0.2-0.5 boost to daytime peaks (08:00-20:00) due to slope_max momentum, but keep volatility/pattern identical. No other corrections needed. Ensures 24 points, realistic EPF-FR diurnal cycle.
<tool_think>
All tools used: reference as base, exogenous confirms diurnal alignment, no changepoint/quality issues, stats support predictability.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-23 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-24 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a typical daily electricity price pattern: night low (39→34→30→27→26), morning rise (27→30→34→36→38), midday peak (38→38→37), afternoon decline (37→36→34→33→32→32), evening rise (31→33→36→39→40→39→39→37). This matches historical intraday patterns in the data (lows ~20-30 at night, highs ~40-50 daytime).

**Exogenous Analysis:** High correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.92) and ""System load forecast"" (0.89), but no actual exogenous values provided for prediction window. Cannot apply specific adjustments; rely on base which likely incorporates these patterns from similar cases.

**Comprehensive Features & Changepoint/Trend:**
- No changepoints (score=0), so no regime shift/truncation needed.
- High flatline_ratio (0.89) but low flatline_hits (0.018), indicating some stability but not dead signal—reference_prediction already has appropriate low-volatility night/shoulder periods.
- slope_max=14.48 (recent uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=13.39 (acceleration), but monotone_duration low (0.05)—no extreme reversion needed.
- High acf1=0.91, acf_s=0.68: strong daily seasonality captured in reference.
- spec_entropy=0.28 (low, predictable signal), sample_entropy=0.70 (moderate complexity)—supports using reference without aggressive changes.
- median=41.23, mad=6.2: reference aligns (mean ~35, but recent data higher ~42; no major bias shift).
- Data quality good (low saturation/dropout=0.018/0.0)—no clipping or uncertainty expansion.

**Tool Think Summary:** No major corrections needed. Reference_prediction is optimal baseline matching EPF-FR diurnal cycle, recent high-price regime (~40-50), and tool diagnostics. Minor boost possible for evening peaks due to slope_max, but pattern already fits historical peaks. Final prediction uses reference values directly to preserve volatility/fluctuations.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-25 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-26 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a classic daily electricity price pattern: low overnight (starting ~34, dropping to ~24), rising in morning (~29 to 47), peak daytime (~45-49), evening high (~49), then decline (~46 to 41). This matches historical patterns in the data (night lows ~20-40, day peaks ~40-50).

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.92) and ""System load forecast"" (0.84). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment. Electricity prices typically follow load/generation patterns, which align with the diurnal cycle in reference_prediction—no adjustment needed.

**Comprehensive Features & Changepoint/Trend Tool:**
- No changepoints (score=0), so full history valid.
- High flatline_ratio (0.87), but this reflects flat daytime plateaus in historical data (common in EPF-FR); not ""dead signal""—ignore for constant output.
- slope_max=14.5 (morning ramps), slope_second_diff_max=12.1 (acceleration), peak_count=7—confirms diurnal peaks; reference_prediction already captures this.
- median=41.66, mad=5.89; reference mean ~41.2, std ~7.5—matches well, no bias correction.
- acf1=0.92, acf_s=0.58—strong daily seasonality; reference follows this.
- No quality issues (low dropout/saturation).

**Data Quality:** Minor saturation (0.024), quantization (0.12)—clip if needed, but reference within historical bounds (17-50).

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal—closely follows historical diurnal patterns, volatility (drops/rises 10-20 units), and similar cases. No significant corrections needed. Use it directly with minor rounding for float precision.

**Tool Think Summary:** Base is strong; no regime shifts, trends captured, quality ok. Maintain reference fluctuations (no smoothing/monotonic).

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp from input data: ""2016-09-29 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are hourly increments starting from ""2016-09-30 00:00:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [39.551499, 35.713986, ..., 40.630274]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases, so final prediction must closely follow it.

Exogenous analysis: Strong correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.92) and ""System load forecast"" (0.82). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustments. Electricity prices typically follow daily cycles (low night, peak daytime), which reference_prediction already reflects.

Comprehensive features:
- High flatline_ratio (0.89) but low flatline_hits (0.024), indicating some stability but not dead signal.
- High acf1 (0.92) shows strong autocorrelation; reference_prediction preserves this.
- slope_max (15.82) and slope_second_diff_max (11.72) indicate momentum, but no changepoints (score 0.0), so no truncation needed.
- No quality issues (low dropout/saturation).

No major corrections needed: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift), data quality good, no residual bias. Reference_prediction aligns with typical diurnal pattern and historical volatility (MAD=6.65). Use it directly as it matches electricity price behavior.

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Use reference_prediction as-is (primary).
- exogenous_analysis: High correlations noted, but no window values for adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High flatline_ratio but valid signal; high acf1 supports persistence in reference.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints, moderate momentum - no boost/reversion.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-01 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-02 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided). This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**: High correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.91) and ""System load forecast"" (0.78). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Maintain base pattern as it likely incorporates these dynamics.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- Median 43.0, high flatline_ratio (0.92) but peak_count=8 indicates daily peaks.
- acf1=0.90 (strong hourly autocorrelation), acf_s=0.41 (seasonal).
- spec_entropy=0.32 (moderate predictability).
- No changepoints (score=0.0).

**Changepoint/Trend**:
- No regime shifts (changepoint_count=0).
- slope_max=16.0, slope_second_diff_max=15.2 indicate momentum, but base prediction already follows typical diurnal cycle (night low ~20-30, day peak ~40-42).
- flatline_ratio high but with peaks; no need for constant output.
- No truncation or major boost needed; base prediction aligns with historical diurnal pattern.

**Data Quality**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.02); no clipping or uncertainty expansion.

**Final Strategy**: Base prediction shows realistic electricity price diurnal cycle: declining overnight (32→20), morning rise (21→29), midday (28-27), afternoon decline (25→23), evening peak (30→42), late decline (42→39). Matches historical patterns (e.g., peaks 18:00-21:00). No significant corrections needed; use reference values directly to preserve volatility and fluctuations.

<tool_think>
All tools considered: base as foundation, no exogenous values for adjustment, no changepoints, quality good, features confirm diurnal predictability.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-09-27 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-09-28 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided):
[35.63, 31.92, 28.52, 26.12, 26.18, 29.70, 38.62, 45.48, 47.98, 48.58, 47.39, 46.70, 45.33, 44.00, 43.21, 42.43, 42.58, 44.18, 47.31, 49.81, 49.35, 45.78, 43.17, 40.12]
This captures typical diurnal electricity price pattern: night low ~26-36, morning rise to peak ~48-49 daytime, evening drop.

**Exogenous refinement**: Strong correlations (Generation forecast: 0.91, System load forecast: 0.83). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment. Base already incorporates similar historical cases.

**Changepoint & trend analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool and comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=13.44 (positive momentum), slope_second_diff_max=11.72: Recent uptrend acceleration, but base prediction already shows morning rise (supports no downward adjustment).
- flatline_ratio=0.88 high, but flatline_hits=0.018 low, run_length_longest=18: Some flat periods but not dead signal; base has fluctuations, so retain.
- peak_count=8, peak_spacing_cv=0.28: Regular daily peaks, base matches diurnal cycle.
- No mean reversion needed (monotone_duration low).

**Data quality** (data_quality_tool): All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, constant=0), quality good, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive stats**:
- median=42.05, mad=6.76: Base mean ~42.3 aligns well (no bias correction).
- acf1=0.92 high (persistent), acf_s=0.40 (seasonal): Base captures this.
- spec_entropy=0.30 low (predictable signal), sample_entropy=0.82: Support base pattern.
- No major corrections needed.

**Final decision**: Base prediction is optimal foundation, matches historical diurnal patterns (low night, peak day ~48-49, evening drop), incorporates similar cases. Minor rounding to 2 decimals for consistency with input data. No significant deviations.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-11 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-12 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a realistic daily electricity price pattern: high overnight/morning (peaking around 78-80), gradual decline through day, evening peak (~83), then decline. This matches typical EPF-FR diurnal cycles seen in historical data (low night, peaks morning/evening).

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.895) and ""System load forecast"" (0.811). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment. Qualitatively, supports using reference which likely incorporates similar patterns.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=32.16 (significant uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=52.29: Recent acceleration supports morning peak in reference.
- flatline_ratio=0.89 high but flatline_hits=0.012 low: Some stability but not dead signal.
- peak_count=11, sample_entropy=0.90: Confirms volatile, multi-peak pattern matching reference fluctuations.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference already captures momentum.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, quantization=0.12): High reliability, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Stats:** median=49.75, mad=10.36: Reference mean ~68 is elevated (recent uptrend), volatility matches mad. acf1=0.90 high (persistent), spec_entropy=0.45 (structured signal): Reference preserves autocorrelation and fluctuations.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal - closely follows historical patterns, incorporates similar cases, matches volatility/fluctuations. No significant corrections needed. Use directly (minor rounding for floats).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-07 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-08 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided: starts at ~45.5, declines to ~43.0 with typical diurnal pattern - night low, morning rise, daytime peak ~56, evening decline).

**Exogenous refinement**: Strong correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.84) and ""System load forecast"" (0.74). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment. Rely on base which likely incorporates these patterns from similar cases.

**Changepoint & trend analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool and comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0.0, changepoint_count=0.0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=26.18 (high, recent uptrend momentum from Oct 7 peaks ~80), but reference already captures continuation.
- slope_second_diff_max=37.69: Strong acceleration earlier, reference shows controlled peak ~56.
- flatline_ratio=0.93 (high, but historical has peaks/valleys), sample_entropy=0.92 (predictable), peak_count=12: Reference maintains realistic fluctuations.
- No truncation/boost needed; reference aligns with diurnal cycle.

**Data quality** (data_quality_tool): Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.018 low, quantization=0.107 minor). No clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive features**: Median=43.22, mad=10.54 (reference volatility matches ~10-15 range). acf1=0.88 high autocorrelation (reference preserves). No bias/residual corrections needed (residual_mean~0).

**Final decision**: Reference_prediction is optimal foundation matching EPF-FR diurnal patterns (night low, morning ramp-up 06-10h, peak 18-20h, evening drop). Minor smoothing for realism, but preserve exact pattern/volatility. No major deviations.

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Base used directly (diurnal cycle preserved).
- exogenous_analysis: Correlations noted, no window data for adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Volatility/mad matches, high ACF preserved in ref.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints, momentum in ref OK.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data, no interventions.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-09 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are hourly increments starting from ""2016-10-10 00:00:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [39.20, 35.42, 31.56, 27.57, 27.23, 33.39, 44.04, 57.65, 60.52, 59.72, 59.99, 56.54, 54.77, 52.53, 49.40, 47.36, 47.66, 53.14, 61.88, 64.91, 62.07, 57.91, 52.59, 48.02]. This captures typical daily electricity price patterns: low overnight, rising in morning, peak daytime, evening drop.

Exogenous correlations: Strong positive with ""Generation forecast"" (0.78) and ""System load forecast"" (0.72). No specific future values provided, so no direct adjustment, but reinforces using base which likely incorporates similar patterns.

Comprehensive features:
- High flatline_ratio (0.89) but low flatline_hits (0.018), minor data artifacts, not dominant.
- No changepoints (score=0), so full history valid.
- High slope_max (26.18) and slope_second_diff_max (37.69) indicate momentum, but base already models this.
- High acf1 (0.87) and acf_s (0.54) show strong autocorrelation/seasonality, matched by base's fluctuations.
- Median 45.52, base mean ~49.5 (rough calc), minor positive bias but within MAD (8.54).
- Low spec_entropy (0.38), predictable signal; sample_entropy high but not overriding.
- Data quality good: low saturation (0.018), no dropouts/constants.

Changepoint_trend: No regime shift, high momentum captured in base. No need for truncation/boost/reversion.

Data quality: Minor saturation, no clipping needed (base within historical bounds ~20-80).

Overall: Base prediction aligns well with patterns (night low ~27-39, morning rise to ~60, day ~50-65, evening drop ~48). No major corrections; minor bias shift toward median (-2-4) optional but base volatility/pattern preserved as instructed. Use base directly for final prediction.

<tool_think>
Used model_auxiliary_tool as foundation (no deviation).
Exogenous: Correlations support base (load/gen drive peaks).
Comprehensive/changepoint/data_quality: No triggers for adjustment (no changepoints, good quality, momentum in base).

   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-05 23:00:00"". Next 24 hours start from ""2016-10-06 00:00:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [27.73, 24.55, 21.45, 19.51, 20.14, 24.73, 34.57, 45.19, 47.91, 48.22, 46.49, 45.05, 40.82, 37.82, 35.64, 34.13, 36.76, 41.73, 48.82, 54.15, 52.38, 47.94, 43.88, 37.52]. This captures typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning, peak evening, drop late night. I will use this as the core, with minor refinements.

Tool analysis:
<tool_think>
- exogenous_analysis: Strong correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.87) and ""System load forecast"" (0.71). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment possible. Assume base model incorporates these patterns from similar cases.
- comprehensive_feature_tool / changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints (score=0), so no regime truncation. High flatline_ratio (0.93) but low flatline_hits (0.018), indicating some stability but not dead signal—retain fluctuations. slope_max=21.34 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=37.69 (acceleration), peak_count=11—supports boosting morning rise and evening peak, but base already matches. Low changepoint_score means full history valid. spec_entropy=0.33 (moderate predictability), acf1=0.84 (strong persistence)—base prediction aligns.
- data_quality_tool: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, quantization=0.11)—no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.
- Overall: Data reliable, strong daily cycle. Median=41.36, mad=8.65—base prediction mean ~39.5, volatility matches mad.
</tool_think>

Refinement: Base prediction closely matches recent history (e.g., Oct 5 similar to predicted pattern). No major corrections needed—no bias shift (means align), no reversion (monotone_duration low), no reversal (no negative accel signal). Retain base pattern/volatility: expect typical Wednesday pattern post-midnight low.

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction values directly (rounded to 2 decimals for consistency with input data).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-03 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-04 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided):
[39.117789, 34.307016, 30.737158, 28.572507, 29.087317, 33.251759, 42.317483, 51.917611, 54.027658, 54.455882, 53.003443, 51.58251, 50.204502, 48.529676, 46.015213, 44.208462, 44.447011, 48.145422, 52.956982, 57.85122, 55.747485, 52.043079, 48.340826, 44.134003]

This shows typical daily pattern: night low ~28-39, morning rise to peak ~54 daytime, evening peak ~58, then decline. Matches historical EPF-FR electricity price patterns (low night, peaks morning/evening).

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Strong correlations (Generation forecast: 0.872, System load forecast: 0.773). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment. Reference_prediction likely already incorporates similar historical exogenous patterns.

**comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool**:
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=21.34, slope_second_diff_max=37.69: Recent momentum captured in reference.
- flatline_ratio=0.92 high but flatline_hits=0.018 low: Some flat periods but not dominant; reference shows proper fluctuations.
- peak_count=9, sample_entropy=0.86: Regular daily cycles with moderate complexity; reference matches.
- No need for truncation/boost/reversion; reference aligns.

**data_quality_tool**:
- Low saturation (0.018), no dropout/constant issues: Data reliable, no clipping needed.

Historical median=43.22, reference avg ~45.5 (slightly higher, reasonable for pattern continuation). acf1=0.86 high (persistent), acf_s=0.49 (seasonal) - reference preserves this.

No major corrections needed: Reference is optimal foundation from similar cases.
</tool_think>

**Final Decision**: Use reference_prediction directly as it captures patterns, volatility, and cycles. Minor rounding to 2 decimals for price realism, but keep precise as provided.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-15 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-16 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION: [40.777347, 37.784209, 32.246725, 29.301867, 25.673122, 25.599966, 28.547315, 32.730093, 33.60065, 34.059233, 33.652583, 33.626594, 32.860094, 32.116617, 30.99076, 28.8624, 27.977905, 32.815057, 40.465466, 49.870318, 50.057064, 46.14206, 45.088673, 44.04711]. This shows typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning, peak evening. Closely follow this pattern and volatility.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** High correlations (Generation forecast: 0.941, System load forecast: 0.88). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Assume base model incorporated these; minor positive bias possible but stick close to reference.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=32.16 (significant uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=52.29: Recent acceleration supports morning rise in reference.
- flatline_ratio=0.93 high, flatline_hits=0.036: Some flat periods, but peak_count=10 indicates diurnal cycles; reference already smooths appropriately.
- No truncation/boost needed; reference captures momentum.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.036 low, quantization=0.095). No clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=56.98 (reference mean ~36 lower, possible recent drop context), mad=13.68 (reference volatility matches), acf1=0.90 high autocorrelation (reference preserves), spec_entropy=0.36 moderate predictability. No major bias correction; reference aligns with pattern.

**Final Strategy:** Use reference_prediction directly as it matches EPF-FR diurnal electricity patterns (night low ~25-40, day ~30-35, evening peak ~50). Minor smoothing for flatline_ratio but preserve fluctuations. No exogenous values for adjustment. Output exactly 24 floats mapped to timestamps.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-13 23:00:00"". Next 24 hours: 2016-10-14 00:00:00 to 2016-10-14 23:00:00.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**:
- High correlations: Generation forecast (0.94), System load forecast (0.88).
- No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustments. Rely on base which likely incorporates these.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- Median 55.0, mad 13.555: Baseline around 55, typical volatility.
- High acf1 (0.90), acf_s (0.53): Strong autocorrelation and seasonality – base prediction should reflect this.
- High flatline_ratio (0.93): Many flat periods, but 11 peaks indicate diurnal cycles.
- Low changepoint_score (0), no regime shift.
- High slope_max (32.16), slope_second_diff_max (52.29): Recent momentum/acceleration – base likely accounts for this.
- No major quality issues (low dropout/saturation).

**Changepoint/Trend**:
- No changepoints, high flatline but with peaks.
- Momentum present but base prediction shows realistic diurnal pattern (night low ~41-54, morning rise to ~78, afternoon decline to ~57-60, evening peak ~76 then drop).
- No need for truncation/boost/reversion; pattern matches typical electricity load (low night, peaks day/evening).

**Data Quality**: Minor saturation (0.04), no clipping needed.

**Final Decision**: Base prediction is strong foundation matching diurnal cycle, volatility, and historical patterns. No significant corrections needed – use it directly (minor rounding for float consistency).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-21 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-22 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**: High correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.96) and ""System load forecast"" (0.90). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustments. Electricity prices typically follow these patterns, which are likely embedded in the base prediction.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- High flatline_ratio (0.94) but low flatline_hits (0.024), indicating some stability but not dead signal.
- High acf1 (0.92) and acf_s (0.69): Strong autocorrelation and seasonality – base prediction should already capture this.
- slope_max (23.72) and slope_second_diff_max (29.84): Recent momentum present, but no changepoints (score=0), so no truncation needed.
- peak_count=9: Daily peak patterns (evening peaks observed in history).
- spec_entropy=0.40 (moderate noise), sample_entropy=0.81: Use conservative adjustments.
- median=62.7, mad=16.3: Base prediction aligns (starts ~66, mean ~58-60, within range).
- Data quality good (low dropout/saturation).

**Changepoint/Trend**: No regime shift (changepoint=0). Positive slope_max suggests momentum continuation, but base prediction shows realistic diurnal pattern (night low ~50s, morning rise, daytime ~50-60, evening peak ~69, night decline) matching historical peaks around 18:00-20:00.

**Data Quality**: Minor saturation (0.024), no clipping needed.

**Final Strategy**: Base prediction is strong foundation matching historical volatility/patterns (night lows, morning ramp-up, evening peak). No major corrections needed: no changepoints, good quality, correlations implicitly captured. Minor bias check: historical recent mean ~70-75 evening, base peaks at 69 reasonable. Maintain exact pattern/volatility.

No tool_think needed as adjustments minimal.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-19 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-20 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided):
[59.89, 54.97, 49.38, 47.18, 46.57, 52.47, 65.50, 80.39, 84.36, 84.37, 82.46, 81.04, 77.52, 74.21, 70.86, 68.83, 69.80, 72.87, 80.63, 88.52, 82.45, 71.80, 66.35, 64.61]
This captures typical daily pattern: night low ~45-60, morning rise to peak ~80-85 around 08-10h, afternoon decline, evening peak ~88 around 19h, then drop.

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong correlations (Gen forecast 0.93, System load 0.88). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so minor adjustment not applied. Base already incorporates similar historical cases.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive):
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=23.72 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=33.84: Recent acceleration supports morning/evening peaks in base pred - no reversal needed.
- flatline_ratio=0.92 high but flatline_hits low (0.018), peak_count=9: Structured flats (night/off-peak), not dead signal. Base pred already follows this.
- monotone_duration low (0.05): No mean reversion needed.
No major corrections; base pred aligns.

**Data Quality** (quality_* low issues): Reliable, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Stats** (comprehensive_feature_tool):
- median=58.78, mad=13.25: Base pred mean ~70 (slightly high), but recent days show peaks 80-90, so acceptable (no strong bias correction).
- acf1=0.91 high (persistent), acf_s=0.54 (seasonal): Base pred shows realistic hourly persistence + daily cycle.
- spec_entropy=0.35 low (predictable), sample_entropy=0.82: Supports base pattern.
No injections/averaging needed.

**Final Decision**: Base prediction is optimal - matches volatility, daily cycle (lows 45-60, peaks 80-88), historical patterns (Thu-Fri similar to prior). Minor rounding for float precision, no deviations.

<tool_think>
All tools confirm: reference_prediction is strong foundation. High flatline_ratio reflects normal off-peak flats (base handles). Strong exo correlations implicitly in base model. No quality issues or regime shifts.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-17 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-18 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided):
[48.575205, 42.769877, 39.098764, 36.185934, 36.36725, 42.288606, 55.44772, 70.331889, 74.287314, 74.293082, 72.164702, 70.681943, 67.949774, 65.801923, 62.684035, 60.212624, 58.631551, 62.493191, 70.29852, 78.118848, 73.152333, 64.462452, 57.831184, 55.170475]

This shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, morning ramp-up, daytime peak ~74-78, evening drop.

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: High correlations (Generation forecast: 0.945, System load: 0.881). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment possible. Base prediction likely already incorporates similar patterns.

**comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool**:
- High flatline_ratio (0.94): Indicates many flat periods, but peak_count=10 shows diurnal cycles preserved.
- slope_max=32.16, slope_second_diff_max=52.29: Recent momentum in ramps/peaks, base prediction captures this with morning rise (42→70) and evening peak (62→78).
- changepoint_score=0, no regime shift - use full history.
- acf1=0.90, acf_s=0.51: Strong autocorrelation and seasonality - base follows this.
- spec_entropy=0.35 (moderate), sample_entropy=0.84: Predictable diurnal signal.
- No need for major corrections (e.g., no truncation, boost, or reversion).

**data_quality_tool**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, quantization=0.095) - data reliable, no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

Historical context: Last point 52.23 aligns with base start ~48.6 (reasonable drop). Recent days show weekend lows (Oct 15-16 ~30-60), weekdays higher peaks. Oct 18 likely weekday continuation.
</tool_think>

**Final Decision**: Base prediction is optimal - captures volatility, diurnal cycle, and historical similarity. Minor smoothing for flatline_ratio but preserve fluctuations. No significant deviations.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-25 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-26 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [60.945882, 53.680579, 48.243344, 46.001195, 47.299266, 53.942822, 70.76698, 86.968814, 94.772011, 96.631681, 93.688525, 91.995331, 88.804342, 87.404523, 82.270928, 82.276015, 83.148252, 87.263848, 96.619218, 104.278373, 96.002922, 82.320392, 74.841977, 69.132765]. This captures the typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning peak, high daytime, evening peak around hour 19, then decline.

Exogenous correlations: Strong positive correlation with ""Generation forecast"" (0.94) and ""System load forecast"" (0.83), but no specific values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment possible. Rely on base.

Comprehensive features: High flatline_ratio (0.95) but low flatline_hits (0.024), indicating some stability but not dead signal. High acf1 (0.91) shows strong autocorrelation, consistent with diurnal electricity patterns. slope_max (26.24) and slope_second_diff_max (33.41) indicate momentum, but no changepoints (score 0). No regime shift or truncation needed. Data quality good (low dropout/saturation).

Recent history (last 24h) shows typical pattern: night low ~40s, morning rise to 70-100s, day high 80-120s, evening peak 123, then drop to 63.91. Base prediction aligns well: starts at ~61 (continuation from 63.91 drop), follows night-day-evening cycle.

No major corrections needed: changepoint_score=0 (no truncation), quality issues minimal, no exogenous values for adjustment. Use reference_prediction directly as it matches historical volatility/patterns (e.g., peaks at ~104 hour 19, declines after).

Final prediction: Assign reference values to timestamps.
<tool_think>
- Used model_auxiliary_tool as base (primary).
- exogenous_analysis: High correlations noted but no prediction window values, no adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High ACF, no changepoints, good quality → validate base pattern.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No regime shift, momentum consistent → no boost/reversal.
- data_quality_tool: Minor saturation (0.024), no clipping needed.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-23 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-24 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided, capturing temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases).

**Exogenous analysis**: Strong correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.95) and ""System load forecast"" (0.86). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct numerical adjustments. Maintain base pattern as it likely incorporates these influences.

**Comprehensive features**:
- High flatline_ratio (0.946) indicates many flat periods, but peak_count=10 shows distinct daily peaks.
- slope_max=23.72 and slope_second_diff_max=29.84 indicate strong momentum/acceleration in peaks - base prediction already shows morning rise (42→72), afternoon dip (78→63), evening peak (69→88→82), late drop (74→62), matching typical electricity diurnal cycle.
- No changepoints (score=0), so full history valid.
- sample_entropy=0.93 (predictable structure), acf1=0.89 (strong persistence) - base prediction preserves this.

**Changepoint_trend_tool**: Confirms no regime shift (changepoint=0). High slope_max supports boosting peaks if needed, but base already has realistic peaks ~88 (historical peaks reach 100). flatline_ratio high but not ""dead signal"" (peaks present). No truncation or major reversion needed.

**Data quality**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.024 minor) - no clipping or uncertainty expansion required.

**Final decision**: Base prediction closely matches historical patterns (night low ~33-47, morning ramp to ~78, daytime ~65-75, evening peak ~88, night drop). Minor refinement: slight upward bias correction as residual_mean≈0 but recent data shows weekend lows transitioning to weekday highs - boost early morning slightly (+1-2) and evening peak (+1) for momentum, but stay very close to reference to preserve volatility/fluctuations. No monotonic changes; maintain fluctuations.

Adjusted prediction (close to reference, preserving pattern):

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-27 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-28 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):**
Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 24 values provided):
[49.81, 44.00, 38.91, 34.92, 35.03, 40.95, 53.86, 70.64, 77.36, 77.79, 75.59, 73.33, 69.18, 67.20, 63.91, 62.01, 61.84, 67.87, 77.71, 86.07, 77.75, 68.42, 62.60, 58.50]
This captures typical diurnal pattern: night low -> morning rise -> daytime peak around evening -> night decline. Volatility matches historical electricity prices.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
Strong positive correlations: Generation forecast (0.89), System load forecast (0.81). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment. Qualitatively supports base pattern (load/generation drive diurnal peaks).

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=26.24 (recent uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=33.41: Recent acceleration supports morning rise in base prediction.
- flatline_ratio=0.94 high, but flatline_hits=0.024 low, peak_count=9: Data has diurnal structure despite some flats; base prediction already accounts for this.
- monotone_duration=0.05 low: No extreme trend needing reversion.
No major corrections needed; base prediction aligns.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):**
quality_saturation_ratio=0.024 low, dropout=0, quantization=0.13: Good quality, no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Features:**
median=62.87, mad=16.73: Base prediction averages ~65, within reasonable range (no bias shift).
acf1=0.905 high autocorrelation: Supports smooth diurnal continuation in base.
spec_entropy=0.41 moderate: Not overly noisy, base is appropriate.
No `_llm_comprehensive_hints` triggers for adjustment.

**Final Decision:**
No significant corrections warranted. Use reference_prediction directly (minor rounding for output). Maintains required volatility, diurnal pattern, and historical similarity. Thursday-to-Friday transition typical for EPF-FR (workday peak).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-29 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-10-30 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [44.27, 39.20, 31.68, 30.09, 25.08, 23.94, 28.76, 34.58, 37.55, 39.18, 40.54, 40.00, 38.62, 36.47, 34.64, 30.68, 32.81, 39.93, 51.84, 60.88, 59.65, 54.38, 49.09, 45.85]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases - typical daily cycle with morning rise, daytime peak, evening drop.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlations (Generation forecast: 0.88, System load forecast: 0.79). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Maintain base pattern as it likely incorporates these influences.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=26.24 (uptrend momentum): Slight boost possible, but reference already accounts for patterns.
- slope_second_diff_max=33.41: No deceleration signal for early reversal.
- flatline_ratio=0.91 high: Some flat periods, but peak_count=8 indicates cycles; reference shows proper fluctuations - no need for constant output.
- monotone_duration low: No mean reversion needed.
- No truncation/boost required; reference handles dynamics.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.02, constant=0). Reliable data, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=59.94, but recent values lower (~48-55), reference starts appropriately lower.
- acf1=0.91 high autocorrelation: Reference preserves persistence.
- spec_entropy=0.42 moderate: Reference volatility appropriate, no conservative smoothing needed.
- No major corrections per _llm_comprehensive_hints.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation. Minor rounding for clean floats. No significant deviations needed - maintains volatility, daily cycle (night low -> morning rise -> peak ~20:00 -> evening drop). Recent history (Oct 29: dropping to 48.73) aligns with reference start ~44.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-10-31 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-01 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [43.82, 39.38, 34.36, 32.30, 32.21, 38.57, 48.51, 59.84, 65.50, 65.58, 63.06, 59.96, 57.56, 55.99, 53.12, 53.19, 55.32, 61.13, 70.04, 73.21, 67.71, 59.10, 54.21, 50.05]. This captures typical daily electricity price pattern: night low, morning rise, daytime peak, evening decline.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.87) and ""System load forecast"" (0.79). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Expect prices to follow typical load/generation patterns (low night, high day), which aligns with reference_prediction's shape.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=25.16 (significant uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=33.41: Recent acceleration supports boosting morning/day peaks, but reference already incorporates this.
- flatline_ratio=0.94 high, but flatline_hits=0.024 low, run_length_derivative=6: Some flat periods but not dead signal; maintain reference fluctuations.
- peak_count=10, peak_spacing_cv=0.36: Regular daily peaks, reference matches.
- No truncation or major correction needed; reference handles momentum.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.024, constant=0): High quality data, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=56.06, mad=12.94, acf1=0.91 (strong autocorrelation), spec_entropy=0.42 (moderate predictability). Reference mean ~54 aligns with median; no bias correction. High acf supports reference's smooth pattern.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation matching daily cycle, correlations, and features. Minor smoothing for continuity from last historical=45.47 (close to first ref=43.82). No major deviations needed. Maintain volatility/pattern.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-04 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-05 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [56.79, 52.65, 47.15, 45.28, 42.28, 46.49, 53.46, 63.80, 66.33, 63.41, 60.74, 59.45, 53.59, 54.62, 49.53, 47.91, 54.56, 68.63, 90.94, 82.68, 65.83, 55.67, 54.70, 48.69]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases, so final prediction must closely follow this pattern (typical daily cycle: low overnight, morning rise, daytime peak, evening drop).

<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Strong correlations (Generation forecast: 0.85, System load: 0.75) suggest load/peak patterns are key, but no specific exogenous values provided for prediction window. No direct adjustment needed; base already incorporates similar cases.

**comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool**:
- High flatline_ratio (0.95) and flatline_hits (0.036), but recent data shows volatility (peaks at 171, 155) – not dead signal.
- slope_max=80.96 (strong uptrend momentum recently), slope_second_diff_max=131.42 (acceleration), peak_count=8 – supports boosting daytime/evening peaks, but base already has peaks at ~90 (h19), consistent with recent evening highs (171→120→87→70→62).
- No changepoints (score=0), so use full history.
- acf1=0.81, acf_s=0.63 (strong autocorrelation/seasonality) – base captures this.
- sample_entropy=0.89 (predictable), spec_entropy=0.55 (moderate noise) – conservative adherence to base.
- median=52.85 aligns with base mean (~57, slight high bias ok given recent uptrend).

**data_quality_tool**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.036 minor) – no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

Overall: No major corrections. Recent pattern (high evenings dropping to ~56) matches base evening drop then morning cycle. Minor boost to evening peaks (+2-3% for momentum/slope_max), but keep close to base volatility/pattern.
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Use base with tiny momentum adjustment (add ~0.5 to peak hours h17-h20 for slope_max, negligible elsewhere) to respect tools while staying faithful to reference.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-06 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-07 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a typical daily electricity price pattern: low overnight (45.5→30.4), morning rise (to 61.2), afternoon peak around evening (88.9 at ~19th hour), then evening decline. This matches historical intraday patterns in the data (night lows ~30-45, evening peaks ~60-100+).

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.83) and ""System load forecast"" (0.67). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Expect alignment with typical load patterns (higher in evening), which reference already captures.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):** 
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- High slope_max=80.96 and slope_second_diff_max=131.42: Recent strong upward momentum (e.g., evening spikes), but reference already incorporates via similar cases.
- flatline_ratio=0.93 high: Some flat periods, but peak_count=7 indicates volatility; reference shows appropriate fluctuations.
- No need for truncation/boost/reversion; reference handles momentum.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.03 low, quantization=0.2 moderate). No clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Features:** Median=53.1, mad=11.2 (reference volatility matches ~10-20 spreads). acf1=0.81 high autocorrelation (reference preserves). spec_entropy=0.54 moderate noise. No major corrections needed.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal baseline matching historical patterns, volatility, and tool insights. No significant adjustments required. Use it directly for the 24 points.

**Timestamps:**

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-02 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-03 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided, capturing temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases).

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.885) and ""System load forecast"" (0.826). However, no actual exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no specific numerical adjustments possible. Maintain base pattern which likely incorporates these dynamics.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- High flatline_ratio (0.946) but low flatline_hits (0.024), indicating some stability but not dead signal.
- High acf1 (0.881) shows strong autocorrelation - base prediction should capture this.
- slope_max (24.48) and slope_second_diff_max (33.73) indicate momentum, but no changepoints (score=0), so no truncation needed.
- No quality issues (low dropout/saturation).
- No major corrections needed; base prediction aligns with characteristics.

**Changepoint/Trend**: No regime shifts. Recent data shows typical daily cycle (night low ~50-57, morning rise to peak ~70-100 evening, drop). Base prediction follows this pattern closely.

**Data Quality**: Clean data, no clipping or uncertainty amplification.

**Final Decision**: Base prediction is optimal foundation. No significant deviations needed. Use reference values directly as they match EPF-FR electricity price patterns (low night, peak evening). Maintain volatility/fluctuations as-is.

**Tool Think Summary**:
- Foundation: reference_prediction (primary).
- No exogenous adjustments (no values).
- No changepoint/trend corrections (low scores).
- Quality OK.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-08 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are hourly increments starting from ""2016-11-09 00:00:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool (PRIMARY FOUNDATION): Use the 24 reference values as the core pattern. They show typical daily electricity price behavior: low overnight, rising in morning, peak evening (notable spike at index 18 ~383, then drop), which matches historical patterns with evening peaks and occasional extreme spikes.

Tool analysis for refinements:
<tool_think>
- exogenous_analysis: Positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.55) and ""System load forecast"" (0.42). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment. Reference already incorporates similar historical cases, so maintain base.

- comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool: 
  - High slope_max (736.76) and slope_second_diff_max (1310.32) indicate strong momentum and acceleration in past spikes.
  - flatline_ratio high (0.91) but with peak_count=4 and residual_exceed_ratio=0.012 (outliers like 874,850), signal has structure amid flats.
  - No changepoint (score=0), so use full history.
  - sample_entropy low (0.25), predictable diurnal pattern. Reference captures this well - no need for major regime shift.
  - Hints: High qkurt (4.41) suggests fat tails; reference has realistic spike at ~383 (similar to past 171-874).

- data_quality_tool: saturation_ratio=0.089 (low), no clipping needed. quantization=0.51 moderate, reliable.

Overall: Reference is strong foundation matching volatility (MAD~15.7), diurnal cycle (acf_s=0.49), and spike potential. Minor bias correction: historical median=62, reference mean~110 (pulled by spike), but pattern valid given extremes. No exogenous for adjustment. Keep close to reference, slight smoothing for stability.
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Use reference values directly as they optimally capture similar cases, volatility, and patterns. No major corrections needed.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-10 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-11 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool**: Reference prediction shows typical daily electricity price pattern: low overnight (32-19), morning rise (35-86), daytime peak around 149 at evening, then evening drop (107-39). Matches historical diurnal cycles seen in data (night lows ~30-50, day peaks ~70-140+, evening spikes).

**exogenous_analysis**: Positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.54) and ""System load forecast"" (0.42). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment. Reference likely incorporates these via similar cases.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 62.05 (baseline), MAD 17.57 (volatility). High qkurt (4.6) indicates fat tails/peaks. High flatline_ratio (0.93) but low changepoint (0), high slope_max (736) and slope_second_diff_max (1310) from outlier spikes (e.g., 874). Reference already handles spikes via similar cases. Spec_entropy 3.19 (noisy), so conservative adherence to reference.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score 0), but extreme slopes from past spikes. Peak_count 4, low monotone_duration (0.065). No truncation/boost needed; reference extrapolates post-spike normalization.

**data_quality_tool**: Saturation_ratio 0.083 (low, from spikes), no dropout/constant issues. No clipping required (historical max ~874, reference max 149 reasonable).
</tool_think>

**Final Decision**: Reference_prediction is optimal foundation. No major corrections needed (no changepoints, quality ok, exogenous no specifics). Minor smoothing for fat-tail awareness but maintain pattern/volatility (e.g., evening peak at ~149, drops). Use reference directly as it matches EPF-FR diurnal behavior post-spike recovery.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation. It shows typical daily electricity price pattern: low overnight (43-40 range), morning rise (to ~83), midday dip (~67), afternoon rise (75), evening drop (47), peak evening (~100-130), then decline to night (~65-40). This matches historical intraday patterns seen in data (night lows ~40-50, day ~60-80, evening peaks ~100+).

**Exogenous Analysis:** Moderate positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.52) and ""System load forecast"" (0.42). No specific future exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Expect load-driven morning/evening peaks consistent with reference.

**Comprehensive Features:** Median 64.32 (daytime baseline), MAD 14.4 (typical volatility). High flatline_ratio (0.95) but low flatline_hits (0.05) indicates data quality ok, not dead signal. High cusum_max/slope_max (691) from outlier spikes (e.g., 829). Low changepoint_count/score (0). High residual_max from outliers. Spec_entropy moderate (noisy but predictable diurnal). No major regime shift; use full history.

**Changepoint/Trend:** No changepoints (score 0). Extreme slope_max (691)/second_diff (1372) from past spikes (e.g., 18:00 11/14), but current end stable (~57). Low monotone_duration (0.06), moderate peak_count (3). No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference already handles momentum.

**Data Quality:** Saturation_ratio 0.05 (low, from spikes), no dropout/constant issues. No clipping or uncertainty expansion required.

**Overall Correction:** Reference is solid foundation matching historical diurnal cycle. No strong corrections needed (no changepoints, quality ok). Minor bias check: recent 24h mean ~72, reference mean ~62 - slight upward shift possible but reference tuned to similar cases. Maintain reference volatility/pattern (night low-ramp-up-peak-dip).
</tool_think>

**Final Strategy:** Adopt reference_prediction closely as it captures optimal similar-case pattern. No significant deviations per tools. Generate timestamps starting ""2016-11-17 00:00:00"" (next after ""2016-11-16 23:00:00"").

   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-14 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-15 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the PRIMARY foundation: use these 24 values as the core pattern, which captures historical similar cases, volatility, and diurnal electricity price structure (night low, morning rise, daytime peak, evening drop).

Key observations from historical data:
- Typical pattern: Low overnight (40-60), rise in morning (60-100+), peak afternoon/evening (100-150+, occasional spikes like 850/829 at 18:00), drop evening/night.
- Recent days show spikes at 18:00 (850, 829), but reference_prediction shows realistic peak at ~312 (hr 18), then drop - follow this.
- Last value: 78.69, reference starts at 81.15 (smooth continuation).

Tool analysis for refinements:
<tool_think>
**comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool:**
- High slope_max (727.9) and slope_second_diff_max (1372.98): Indicates sharp momentum/peaks (matches historical spikes), but changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- flatline_ratio=0.958 (high, but with flatline_hits=0.054 and peak_count=4): Mostly stable periods interrupted by peaks - reference_prediction already models this with fluctuations.
- No truncation/boost needed; reference captures momentum without lag.
- sample_entropy low (0.248): Predictable structure, trust reference.

**exogenous_analysis:**
- Positive correlations: Generation forecast (0.53), System load forecast (0.40). No specific future values provided, so minor positive bias if assuming typical demand, but reference likely incorporates - no major adjustment.

**data_quality_tool:**
- saturation_ratio=0.054 (low, minor clipping risk from spikes) - clip extreme predictions if any, but reference max 312 is reasonable vs historical 850.
- No dropout/constant issues.

**Overall:** No major corrections needed. Reference_prediction aligns with median~63.6, mad~15.5 volatility, and diurnal pattern. Minor smoothing for continuity from 78.69.
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction directly (best foundation), with tiny adjustment (<1%) for last value continuity and quality clipping (cap >300 conservatively, but not needed).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-18 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-19 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction [59.79, 42.64, 38.84, 17.65, 25.96, 50.12, 54.45, 47.32, 38.25, 56.79, 24.49, 36.33, 43.72, 31.01, 15.11, 23.73, 23.99, 46.53, 87.35, 70.02, 32.36, 28.41, 19.14, 31.76] as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Final prediction must closely follow this pattern, including fluctuations (night lows, morning rise, evening peak around hour 19).

**Exogenous Analysis:** Correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.47) and ""System load forecast"" (0.42). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustments. Expect typical diurnal load patterns (low night, peak evening) which align with reference_prediction's evening peak.

**Comprehensive Features & Changepoint/Trend Tool:**
- High flatline_ratio (0.92) and flatline_hits (0.065), but recent data shows diurnal cycles with peaks (e.g., 829.79 outlier handled).
- slope_max (691.79) and slope_second_diff_max (1372.98) indicate strong past momentum/spikes, but changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift), so no truncation.
- peak_count=3, sample_entropy low (0.29) → predictable diurnal pattern.
- No major corrections needed: no high changepoint, no extreme monotone_duration for reversion, flatline not dominant recently.
- median=63.03, mad=13.11 → reference_prediction mean ~41.8 is lower; slight upward bias possible but reference from similar cases takes precedence.

**Data Quality:** quality_saturation_ratio=0.065 (minor, due to past spike), no clipping needed. All other quality metrics fine.

**Final Strategy:** Use reference_prediction directly as it matches electricity price diurnal patterns (low early morning ~15-40, rise morning ~40-50, evening peak ~87). Minor smoothing for realism (avoid unrealistically low 15-17 given recent lows ~30-50, but keep volatility). No exogenous values for adjustment. Maintain fluctuations, no mono-trend.

Adjusted prediction: Round reference to 2 decimals, slight lift to lows (add ~5-10 to 15-25 range for consistency with historical mins ~30s), preserve pattern.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-12 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are 2016-11-13 00:00:00 to 2016-11-13 23:00:00.

**Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool**: Use the reference_prediction [37.86, 31.78, ..., 2.70] as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Prediction shows typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning, peak evening, drop late night.

**Exogenous analysis**: Correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.54) and ""System load forecast"" (0.42). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so minor refinement only - no major directional shift needed.

**Comprehensive features & changepoint_trend**:
- High flatline_ratio (0.94), flatline_hits (0.07), low changepoint_score (0), low sample_entropy (0.25): Data has many flat periods but also extreme spikes (e.g., 874, 850).
- Extreme slope_max (737), slope_second_diff_max (1310): Recent violent spikes and drops indicate volatility, but no active changepoint.
- peak_count=4, consistent evening peaks.
- No truncation needed (low changepoint_score). No strong momentum boost/reversal (focus on base pattern).
- Hints: High flatline suggests conservative approach, but reference already smooths appropriately.

**Data quality**: saturation_ratio=0.07 (low, minor clipping risk), no dropout. No major uncertainty amplification or clipping required.

**Overall reasoning**:
- Start with reference_prediction as foundation (closely follow its fluctuations: drop to ~4-20 early morning, rise to ~116 afternoon, evening peak ~93-115, drop to ~3).
- Minor upward bias correction: Historical median=63 > reference mean (~35). Shift entire curve up by ~10-15% conservatively to align level/scale (per comprehensive hints).
- Maintain volatility/pattern: Diurnal cycle with morning low, daytime rise, evening peak, night drop.
- No exogenous values, so no strong adjustment.
- Conservative due to flatline_ratio/spec_entropy: Smooth minor outliers but keep reference fluctuations.
- Adjusted values: reference * 1.15 + small noise for realism, clipped to plausible bounds (20-150, avoiding prior extremes without evidence).

Final prediction closely tracks reference shape with level adjustment.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-20 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-21 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (28.50, 20.77, ..., 44.42). This captures optimal patterns from similar cases.

**Exogenous analysis**: Correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.49) and ""System load forecast"" (0.45). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor refinement only - no major directional shift needed.

**Comprehensive features**:
- Median 59.31, but recent data shows downward regime (last 24h: dropping to 44.9).
- High flatline_ratio (0.94) indicates mostly stable periods, but 3 peaks noted.
- High slope_max (691.79) and slope_second_diff_max (1372.98) from past spike (e.g., 829.79 outlier), but changepoint_score=0 (no recent breaks).
- Low changepoint_count=0, so no memory truncation.
- Low sample_entropy (0.29), predictable signal.
- No quality issues (dropout=0, saturation low).

**Changepoint_trend**:
- No regime shift (changepoint_score=0).
- Past high slopes, but current downtrend post-spikes; reference already compensates.
- High flatline_ratio suggests stable base, but reference shows diurnal pattern (low night, peak ~18th hour).
- No mean reversion forced (monotone_duration low).

**Data quality**: Clean (no dropouts, low saturation), no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Final strategy**:
- Closely follow reference_prediction pattern: low overnight (00-05), morning rise (06-11), daytime stable (12-16), evening peak ~18th (116.89), drop after.
- Minor bias correction: recent values ~45-50, reference starts low ~28 but rises appropriately for weekend/Sunday pattern.
- Maintain volatility/fluctuations as in reference (no smoothing).
- No exogenous values, so no adjustment.
- Output exactly these 24 values (floats).

**Tool think**:
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation - use reference directly.
- exogenous_analysis: Correlations noted but no window data → no change.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Recent low levels align with reference start; high past slopes handled in base model.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No truncation/boost needed.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data → confident in reference.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-22 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-23 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: [41.40, 38.09, 33.83, 29.11, 26.87, 35.82, 48.65, 61.64, 65.13, 64.98, 63.72, 62.68, 61.36, 60.92, 60.34, 60.53, 62.25, 67.26, 71.36, 69.23, 62.34, 55.69, 51.86, 47.18]. This captures typical daily electricity price patterns: low overnight, rising in morning, peak evening, falling night.

<tool_think>
Exogenous_analysis: High correlations with ""System load forecast"" (0.85) and ""Generation forecast"" (0.77). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Expect prices to follow typical load patterns (embedded in reference).

Comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints (score=0), so use full history. High flatline_ratio (0.89) indicates periods of stability, but peak_count=7 and slope_max=26.9 show volatility - reference already matches this with fluctuations. No truncation or momentum boost needed. slope_second_diff_max=29.9 suggests acceleration possible, but reference has morning rise.

Data_quality_tool: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.01), no clipping or uncertainty expansion.

Overall: Data reliable, no major corrections. Reference prediction aligns with historical patterns (night low ~30-50, day ~60, evening peak ~70).
</tool_think>

Final prediction uses reference values directly (rounded to 2 decimals for consistency with input data), maintaining exact pattern/volatility. No significant deviations needed.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-28 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-29 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.92) and ""System load forecast"" (0.86). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct numerical adjustments. Maintain base pattern which likely incorporates these dynamics.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- Median ~50.89, MAD ~12.46: Baseline level and volatility reference.
- High flatline_ratio (0.92): Indicates many flat periods, but peak_count=7 shows distinct daily peaks. Reference_prediction appropriately shows typical daily cycle (night low ~35-45, morning rise, daytime peak ~65-75, evening drop).
- High acf1 (0.91), moderate acf_s (0.49): Strong autocorrelation and seasonality - reference_prediction preserves this.
- slope_max=24.26, slope_second_diff_max=22.06: Recent momentum captured in base.
- No changepoints (score=0), good data quality (low dropout/saturation).

**Changepoint/Trend**: No regime shifts. High flatline_ratio but not ""dead signal"" (peaks present). No truncation/boost/reversion needed - base is solid.

**Data Quality**: Minor quantization/saturation, no clipping or uncertainty expansion required.

**Final Decision**: Reference_prediction shows realistic electricity price pattern (low overnight, peak daytime ~70s, evening drop) matching historical cycles (e.g., Nov 22-28 peaks 65-76). No significant corrections needed - use as-is for pattern/volatility fidelity. Minor rounding to 2 decimals for price realism.

<tool_think>
All tools confirm base reliability: no changepoints, good quality, strong daily cycle in reference. Exogenous supports but no window data for adjustment.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-24 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-25 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar cases.

**Exogenous analysis**: High correlations with ""System load forecast"" (0.85) and ""Generation forecast"" (0.83). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct numerical adjustment possible. Maintain base pattern which likely incorporates these dynamics.

**Comprehensive features**:
- Median 50.0, high flatline_ratio (0.89) but low flatline_hits (0.012), indicating periods of stability with fluctuations.
- High acf1 (0.90) and acf_s (0.61): Strong autocorrelation and seasonality – base prediction should align.
- slope_max 26.43, slope_second_diff_max 27.72: Recent momentum present, but no changepoints (score 0.0).
- No regime shift (changepoint_count 0.0), so use full history.
- No data quality issues (low saturation 0.012, no dropouts/constants).
- peak_count 7, sample_entropy 0.81: Expect continued daily peak structure around evening hours, as in base.

**Changepoint_trend**: No regime shift. High slopes indicate momentum, but base already models this. No need for truncation/boost/reversion. flatline_ratio high but not ""dead signal"" level.

**Data quality**: Clean data, no clipping/uncertainty amplification needed.

**Final strategy**: Base prediction shows realistic daily cycle (night low ~30-40, morning rise, daytime ~55-65, evening peak ~65-67, night decline) matching historical EPF-FR patterns (low overnight, peaks 17-20h). No major corrections needed – slight bias correction toward median ~50 possible, but pattern/volatility match well (mean base ~54, historical median 50). Use base directly as it preserves fluctuations, volatility, and cycle.

<tool_think>
All tools confirm: strong serial dependence, no breaks/quality issues, base captures momentum/peaks. Exogenous supports load-driven peaks. No overrides.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-26 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-11-27 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION: [36.514608, 32.291291, 28.359395, 25.807154, 21.398436, 22.525807, 25.80701, 30.934707, 34.037305, 35.206683, 37.051344, 36.766078, 37.446378, 36.364723, 35.240497, 33.607636, 37.192302, 42.467964, 49.479703, 51.327138, 48.944128, 45.336609, 44.090764, 39.262599]. This shows typical daily pattern: night low, morning rise, daytime peak ~50, evening decline. Matches historical electricity price cycles (low overnight, peak evening).

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** High correlations (Gen forecast 0.90, System load 0.86). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment. Base prediction likely already incorporates similar patterns.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=26.43, slope_second_diff_max=27.72: Recent momentum/acceleration present, but base prediction already captures diurnal cycle with peaks.
- flatline_ratio=0.90 high: Some flat periods, but peak_count=7 indicates cycles; base shows fluctuations, so retain.
- monotone_duration low: No extreme reversion needed.
- No truncation/boost/reversal adjustments; base aligns.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.01, quantization=0.10). No clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=48.53 (base avg ~38, slight low bias but cycle-appropriate), mad=10.47 (base volatility matches), acf1=0.90 high autocorrelation (base preserves), spec_entropy=0.36 moderate predictability. No major corrections.

**Final Decision:** Base prediction is optimal foundation, matches historical patterns (e.g., Nov 21-25 nights ~30-40 declining to lows ~20-30, peaks ~65 evening). No significant deviations needed. Use reference_prediction directly for pattern/volatility fidelity.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [41.97, 31.92, 29.46, 18.42, 25.63, 36.52, 52.29, 68.92, 72.72, 77.71, 70.36, 63.09, 61.89, 58.85, 54.92, 56.73, 67.02, 80.88, 99.44, 86.66, 74.33, 61.12, 56.86, 51.67]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases - final prediction must closely follow this pattern (typical daily cycle: low night, peak evening).

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlations (Generation forecast: 0.774, System load forecast: 0.638). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment. Reference_prediction likely already incorporates these via similar historical cases.

**Comprehensive Diagnosis (comprehensive_feature_tool):** 
- Median 65.74, high kurtosis (6.63) indicates fat tails/spikes - reference_prediction appropriately includes evening peak ~99.
- High flatline_ratio (0.93) but low flatline_hits (0.018), some saturation (quality_saturation_ratio 0.018) - minor clipping risk, but no strong action needed (do not clip broadly).
- High acf1 (0.69), moderate seasonal acf_s (0.57) - reference_prediction matches daily cycle.
- No regime shift (changepoint_score=0), but high slope_max (156.5), slope_second_diff_max (299) - past momentum captured in base.
- Spec_entropy 0.91 (noisy) suggests conservative adherence to reference.

**Changepoint/Trend (changepoint_trend_tool):** No changepoints (score=0), high flatline_ratio but not ""dead signal"" threshold. Momentum features confirm volatile history with peaks - no truncation/boost/reversion needed; follow reference cycle.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, constant=0, quantization=0.30 moderate, saturation=0.018 low) - no uncertainty expansion or clipping required.

**Overall Correction:** No major corrections needed. Reference_prediction aligns with diagnostics (daily cycle, volatility, spikes). Minor bias check: historical median ~66 vs reference mean ~61.8 (slight low bias) - apply small uniform +2 shift for level alignment, preserving pattern/volatility. No other adjustments (no exogenous values, no regime shifts, quality ok).
</tool_think>

**Final Strategy:** Start with reference_prediction, add ~2 shift for median alignment (65.74 target). Round to 2 decimals matching input style. Timestamps start from ""2016-12-05 00:00:00"" (next after ""2016-12-04 23:00:00"").

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-02 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-03 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided):
[53.04, 46.56, 42.22, 36.49, 34.99, 41.43, 45.08, 58.13, 58.74, 58.84, 54.51, 51.84, 48.74, 44.59, 40.83, 39.98, 42.24, 60.76, 72.51, 64.80, 50.80, 46.70, 45.20, 47.33]
This captures typical daily pattern: low overnight, rising morning, peak evening, drop night.

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Strong positive correlations (Generation forecast: 0.79, System load: 0.69). Recent peaks at evening hours (17-19) align with high load/generation demand. Reference already incorporates this via similar cases - no major adjustment needed.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 64.91 (reference mean ~50.7, slightly low - minor upward bias possible but pattern dominates). High qkurt=5.43 (fat tails/peaks), acf_s=0.63 (seasonality), spec_entropy~1 (moderate noise). Recent history shows evening spikes (e.g., 266.9). Reference has evening peak at h17 (72.51) matching pattern.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0). High slope_max=156.5, slope_second_diff_max=299 (sharp ramps, typical for EPF-FR peaks). peak_count=6, flatline_ratio=0.96 but hits low (0.012) - data reliable, not dead. No truncation/boost needed; reference handles momentum.

**data_quality_tool**: Low saturation=0.012, no dropouts/constants - high reliability, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.
</tool_think>

**Final Decision**: Reference_prediction is optimal base. Minor upward shift (~+2 based on median diff and recent levels around 60-70 post-peak) to align with historical evening recovery, but preserve exact pattern/volatility (no mono-trend, daily cycle intact). No other corrections (no regime shift, quality fine).

Adjusted prediction: reference + small bias correction, rounded to 2 decimals matching input style.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-08 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-09 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation:
[49.81, 46.02, 43.24, 40.65, 40.00, 44.76, 52.02, 60.91, 63.86, 63.48, 62.36, 59.75, 56.58, 55.44, 54.19, 54.81, 58.74, 65.60, 68.05, 66.85, 62.33, 57.44, 56.11, 53.46]
This shows typical diurnal pattern: low overnight, rising morning, peak afternoon/evening, declining night. Volatility matches historical electricity prices. Final prediction MUST closely follow this pattern.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
Strong positive correlations: Generation forecast (0.86), System load forecast (0.80). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no numerical adjustments. Expect morning rise (hours 6-9) and evening peak (17-19) to align with typical load/generation patterns, which reference_prediction already captures well.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0.0, changepoint_count=0.0: No regime shifts, use full history.
- slope_max=16.28 (significant uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=22.82: Recent acceleration supports morning boost in reference_prediction (52→61→64).
- flatline_ratio=0.88 high but flatline_hits=0.018 low: Some flat periods but not dominant; reference_prediction has appropriate fluctuations.
- peak_count=12, peak_spacing_cv=0.43: Regular daily peaks; reference_prediction times next peaks correctly.
- No need for truncation, reversion, or constant output. Slight momentum boost possible but reference already aligns.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):**
All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, constant=0): High reliability, no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Features:**
- median=59.79, mad=9.29: Reference mean ~57 aligns well (no bias correction).
- acf1=0.90 high (persistent), acf_s=0.34 (seasonal): Reference captures autocorrelation.
- spec_entropy=0.23 low (predictable signal): Trust model forecast.
- sample_entropy=0.97: Some complexity, but reference handles it.
No major corrections needed.

**Final Strategy:** Use reference_prediction directly as it matches historical patterns, volatility, diurnal cycle, and tool diagnostics. Minor rounding for presentation, but preserve exact pattern/fluctuations. No exogenous values for adjustment. Prediction follows typical weekday electricity price behavior (Dec 9, 2016 was Thursday).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-11-30 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-01 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation: [65.878103, 60.07974, 57.557396, 55.946603, 55.153343, 63.325129, 79.807254, 102.616818, 102.961351, 99.457999, 93.631926, 86.170133, 80.176189, 80.602636, 79.131606, 80.277544, 83.044434, 97.16123, 122.769143, 103.871516, 85.701033, 73.097026, 72.060454, 66.495202]. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases, including daily peaks around evening hours.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.79) and ""System load forecast"" (0.76). Recent history shows high prices during peak load/ low generation periods (e.g., spikes at 18:00 on 11-29/30). Reference_prediction aligns with expected load-driven peaks (high around hours 7-18), so no major directional adjustment needed. Slight upward bias in peaks reasonable given correlation.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift; use full history.
- High slope_max=112.87 and slope_second_diff_max=190.38: Recent strong upward momentum (e.g., 11-30 spikes), but reference_prediction already incorporates deceleration and peaks appropriately (rises to ~123 at hour 18, then falls).
- flatline_ratio=0.95 high but flatline_hits low (0.012); some stability but volatile peaks present (peak_count=6).
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference follows momentum without lag.
- sample_entropy=0.62 moderate predictability; spec_entropy=0.85 indicates some noise – stick close to reference for conservative forecast.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.012 low, quantization=0.16 minor). No clipping or uncertainty expansion required.

**Other Features (comprehensive_feature_tool):** Median=54.86, mad=12.65 – reference mean ~80 aligns with elevated regime post-spikes (historical mean pulled up by recent highs). acf1=0.78 high autocorrelation; reference preserves this. No bias/residual corrections (residual_mean~0).

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation. Recent context (high volatility, evening peaks ~100-200) matches pattern. Minor smoothing for noise (avg adjacent where minor dips), but preserve fluctuations/volatility. No exogenous values provided for window, so correlation confirms directionality only. Output exactly these 24 values (floats) matched to timestamps.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-06 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-07 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a typical daily electricity price pattern: low overnight (53-42 range), rising in morning (44->66->82), peak daytime (87->84->77), gradual decline evening (72->63->59). This matches historical intraday patterns seen in the data (e.g., peaks around 18:00, lows early morning).

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.71) and ""System load forecast"" (0.62). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. However, the reference_prediction likely already incorporates similar historical exogenous patterns from analogous cases. No major override needed.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift, use full history.
- High slope_max (156.5) and slope_second_diff_max (299): Indicates sharp past peaks/moves, but reference_prediction already captures similar volatility.
- High flatline_ratio (0.92): Suggests periods of stability, but recent data shows fluctuations; reference follows this with smooth declines/rises.
- peak_count=6, sample_entropy=0.58: Confirms daily cycle with moderate complexity – reference matches.
- No need for truncation/boost/reversion; reference is aligned.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.05 low, quantization=0.27 moderate). No clipping or uncertainty expansion required.

**Comprehensive Features:** Median=65.8, mad=13.4 aligns with reference mean (~68) and volatility. acf1=0.71 high autocorrelation supports persistence in reference's smooth pattern. No bias correction needed (residual_mean~0).

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation from similar cases. No significant corrections warranted by tools. Use it directly for the 24 points to preserve pattern, volatility, and daily cycle.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-10 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-11 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a typical daily electricity price pattern: low overnight (around 35-46), rising in morning (37-45), peak evening (48-54), then decline. This matches historical weekday patterns (Dec 11 is Sunday, but reference captures similar cases). Mean ~44.3, volatility preserved.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.90) and ""System load forecast"" (0.79). No specific forecast values provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment. Qualitatively supports morning rise and evening peak in reference.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=16.28 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=22.82: Recent uptrend acceleration, but reference already incorporates - slight boost to morning hours reasonable, but minimal change.
- flatline_ratio=0.89 high: Some flat periods, but peak_count=11 indicates diurnal cycles; reference has fluctuations, so preserve.
- monotone_duration low: No mean reversion needed.
- No truncation or major overrides.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.018, quantization=0.095): High reliability, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features:** median=55.05 (reference mean ~44 lower, but recent data declining from peaks ~80 to ~52, so reference aligns with downtrend continuation). acf1=0.90 high autocorrelation (reference smooth transitions good). spec_entropy=0.21 low (predictable signal). event_dominant_pattern=1.0 (upward bias minor). No major corrections needed.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation. Minor refinements: slight upward shift (+0.5 avg) for slope_max momentum and correlations supporting load/generation peaks, but preserve exact pattern/volatility. No other overrides. Prediction closely tracks reference with tiny momentum adjustment.

**Adjusted values:** Start from reference, add ~0.2-0.8 linear momentum compensation tapering off (total shift <5% to stay close).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-12 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-13 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.85) and ""System load forecast"" (0.80). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct numerical adjustment. Maintain base pattern which likely incorporates these dynamics.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- Median 55.97, high flatline_ratio (0.89) but low flatline_hits (0.012), acf1 0.88 (strong autocorrelation), low spec_entropy (0.18, predictable signal).
- No changepoints (score 0), slope_max 21.66 indicates recent momentum.
- event_dominant_pattern 1.0 suggests upward tendency.
- Data quality good (low saturation 0.012, no dropouts).

**Changepoint/Trend**:
- No regime shifts (changepoint 0).
- High slope_max and slope_second_diff_max suggest momentum, but since recent data shows evening peak at 18:00 (100.28) followed by drop to 55.42, expect typical diurnal cycle: night low -> morning rise -> daytime peak -> evening decline.
- Reference_prediction aligns: starts ~54 (night), rises to ~81 (evening peak ~18:00), then drops to ~58.

**Data Quality**: Minor saturation, no clipping needed.

**Final Strategy**: 
- Foundation: reference_prediction exactly matches expected diurnal pattern seen in historical data (low night, peak ~17-18h, decline).
- No major corrections needed: no changepoints, good predictability, aligns with correlations and recent momentum.
- Minor bias check: historical median ~56 vs ref mean ~65 (slightly higher, typical for peak day cycle), no shift required.
- Output reference_prediction values directly as they preserve volatility, fluctuations, and realistic EPF-FR patterns.

<tool_think>
All tools confirm reference_prediction reliability: strong ACF, low entropy, no quality issues, diurnal momentum preserved.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### basic_statistics_tool
- Description: Advanced statistics tool (LEVEL & SCALE): Extracts ~10 core statistical features including median, MAD, ACF, spectral entropy, CUSUM, quantile kurtosis. Use for: (1) Bias Correction - if median differs from model prediction, shift prediction curve; (2) Confidence Interval - if MAD is high, expand uncertainty bounds; (3) Periodicity Injection - if acf_s is high but model output is flat, add periodic fluctuations; (4) Predictability Gate - if spec_entropy is high (noisy), use conservative strategy.

- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-14 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-15 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a realistic daily cycle: night low (~48-58), morning rise, daytime high (~66-82 peaking evening), evening decline. Mean ~66.5, volatility matches historical peaks ~80s and troughs ~50s. This captures similar historical cases perfectly - MUST follow closely.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** High correlations (Gen forecast 0.82, System load 0.80) suggest demand-driven prices. Reference_prediction already incorporates these patterns from similar cases, so no major adjustment needed without specific future exogenous values.

**Statistical Baseline (basic_statistics_tool):** Historical median 55.97, reference mean ~66.5 (higher due to recent uptrend/Dec season). MAD 9.3 indicates moderate volatility - matches reference fluctuations. High ACF1 0.90 and ACF_s 0.64 confirm strong hourly/daily autocorrelation - reference preserves this. Low spec_entropy 0.20 = predictable signal, no conservative damping needed.

**Trend & Regime (changepoint_trend_tool):** No changepoints (score=0), so full history valid. High slope_max 21.7 and slope_second_diff_max 41.3 indicate sharp ramps (e.g., evening peaks) - reference already models these. Low monotone_duration 0.06, high flatline_ratio 0.90 but low hits 0.01 = normal hourly flats, not dead signal. Peak_count 9 over 168h (~daily) with regular spacing - reference follows cycle.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Clean data (dropout=0, constant=0, low saturation 0.01) - no clipping or uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive:** No regime breaks, predictable signal, recent high levels - reference optimal. No bias shift (recent data > median), no reversion needed.

**Final Decision:** Use reference_prediction directly - it matches EPF-FR hourly patterns (night low, peak 17-19h), volatility, and tool diagnostics. Minor smoothing unnecessary as it already has natural fluctuations.
<tool_think>
All tools confirm reference_prediction validity: strong autocorrelation preserved, no quality issues, trend dynamics captured, exogenous correlations implicitly modeled.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-18 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-19 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION: [50.500083, 46.094184, 45.187794, 43.417662, 44.67871, 50.421215, 58.458662, 67.946384, 72.165138, 71.73472, 70.685069, 69.77309, 68.232368, 67.162073, 66.475223, 67.45643, 70.655259, 76.791401, 80.650507, 77.061804, 71.250041, 65.684755, 62.91314, 59.124511]. This captures typical daily electricity price pattern: low overnight, rising morning, peak evening, falling night. Maintain its volatility and fluctuations.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.94) and ""System load forecast"" (0.87). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Electricity prices typically follow load/generation patterns, which align with reference's diurnal cycle—no adjustment needed.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):** 
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=21.66 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=41.32: Recent acceleration supports reference's morning rise—no boost/revision needed as reference already captures.
- flatline_ratio=0.94 high but flatline_hits=0.012 low: Some stability but not dead signal.
- peak_count=8, peak_spacing_cv=0.37: Regular daily peaks, reference follows this.
- No mean reversion (monotone_duration low), no reversal signals.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.012, quantization=0.15)—data reliable, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):** median=62.91, mad=9.48, acf1=0.90 (strong persistence), spec_entropy=0.19 (predictable signal). Reference aligns with median level and volatility—no bias correction needed.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal—closely matches historical patterns, tool signals, and diurnal cycle. No significant corrections required. Use it directly for final prediction.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-16 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-17 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool**: Use the reference_prediction [58.095494, 53.632055, ..., 55.364077] as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Tool analysis**:
- **exogenous_analysis**: High correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.94) and ""System load forecast"" (0.87). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment possible. Rely on base model which likely incorporates these.
- **comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool**:
  - changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shifts, use full history.
  - slope_max=21.66 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=41.32: Recent acceleration suggests potential continuation/boost in peaks, but reference already models this.
  - flatline_ratio=0.92 high: Some flat periods, but peak_count=9 indicates daily cycles; reference shows fluctuations, so maintain.
  - acf1=0.90, acf_s=0.72: Strong autocorrelation/seasonality; reference follows this.
  - median=63.24, mad=10.54: Reference mean ~57 aligns reasonably (slight downward bias possible, but no strong shift needed).
  - spec_entropy=0.20 low: Predictable signal, trust reference.
  - No quality issues (dropout=0, saturation low).
- No need for major corrections: No changepoints, no residuals bias, good quality. Reference already handles cycles (night low ~46-58, day peak ~66, evening drop).

**Final strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches instructions (foundation, volatility, patterns). Minor rounding to 2 decimals for consistency with input data style, but keep as floats.

**Timestamps**:
""2016-12-17 00:00:00"" to ""2016-12-17 23:00:00""

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### basic_statistics_tool
- Description: Advanced statistics tool (LEVEL & SCALE): Extracts ~10 core statistical features including median, MAD, ACF, spectral entropy, CUSUM, quantile kurtosis. Use for: (1) Bias Correction - if median differs from model prediction, shift prediction curve; (2) Confidence Interval - if MAD is high, expand uncertainty bounds; (3) Periodicity Injection - if acf_s is high but model output is flat, add periodic fluctuations; (4) Predictability Gate - if spec_entropy is high (noisy), use conservative strategy.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-20 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are 2016-12-21 00:00:00 to 2016-12-21 23:00:00.

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided, shows typical daily pattern: low overnight, peak daytime ~17-18h, decline evening).

**Tool analysis**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: High correlations (Generation forecast 0.92, System load 0.87). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so cannot make quantitative adjustments. Note for qualitative similarity to load patterns (daytime peaks).

**basic_statistics_tool**: Median 64.05 (reference mean ~69.3, slight high bias - minor downward shift possible but pattern dominates). MAD 11 (moderate vol), ACF1 0.91 (strong persistence), ACF_s 0.57 (seasonal), spec_entropy 0.19 (predictable, low noise). No major bias correction needed; maintain fluctuations.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0). Slope_max 18.95 (momentum present), slope_second_diff_max 27.06 (acceleration). Peak_count 9, flatline_ratio 0.95 but hits low (0.018) - not dead signal. No truncation/boost/reversion needed; follow reference pattern.

**data_quality_tool**: All ratios low (saturation 0.018, no dropouts/constants) - high quality, no clipping/amplification.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Confirms above (median 64, event_segments 8, dominant_pattern 0). No quality issues, predictable signal.
</tool_think>

**Final reasoning**: Reference_prediction captures optimal historical similar patterns (daily cycle matching EPF-FR). No strong corrections needed (no changepoints, quality good, low entropy). Minor level adjustment toward median (~64) but preserve volatility/pattern (peaks ~83, lows ~50). No exogenous values for precise refinement. Prediction closely follows reference with negligible smoothing for persistence.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-22 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-23 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided):
[56.13, 51.60, 49.27, 47.31, 47.28, 50.37, 57.99, 66.84, 71.61, 72.30, 71.50, 70.56, 68.98, 66.89, 65.47, 66.40, 67.57, 73.70, 75.41, 74.00, 68.62, 64.30, 62.44, 60.09]
This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases - MUST follow closely.

**Exogenous refinement** (<tool_think>):
- Strong correlations: Generation forecast (0.94), System load forecast (0.89).
- No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Maintain base pattern as it likely incorporates these influences.

**Changepoint & trend analysis** (<tool_think>):
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=15.58 (positive momentum): Slight boost possible, but reference already accounts.
- slope_second_diff_max=27.06: No deceleration signal for early reversal.
- flatline_ratio=0.87 (high): Some flat periods, but peak_count=8 shows diurnal cycles; reference has fluctuations - preserve them.
- monotone_duration low: No mean reversion needed.
- No truncation/boost required; reference is reliable.

**Data quality** (<tool_think>):
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.012 (low), dropout=0: Good quality, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive features** (<tool_think>):
- median=63.54, reference mean ~64.5: Matches well, no bias correction.
- mad=9.13: Normal volatility, matches reference fluctuations.
- acf1=0.91, acf_s=0.58: Strong autocorrelation/seasonality - reference diurnal pattern (night low ~50, day peak ~70s, evening drop) aligns perfectly.
- spec_entropy=0.17 (low): Predictable signal, trust reference.
- flatline_ratio high but with peaks: Reference correctly models this.

**Final decision**: Reference_prediction is optimal - closely matches historical diurnal cycle (Dec 22 similar: night ~50s, morning rise to ~70s peak, evening decline). No significant corrections needed. Use rounded to 2 decimals for consistency with input data.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-26 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps are 2016-12-27 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00.

**Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool**: Use the reference_prediction [47.06, 42.87, ..., 51.47] as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Final prediction must closely follow this pattern: starts around 47, dips to ~33 mid-morning, rises to peak ~64 in evening, then declines.

**Exogenous analysis**: High correlations (Generation forecast: 0.956, System load: 0.903). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustments. Rely on base which likely incorporates these.

**Comprehensive features**:
- Median 53.42, high flatline_ratio (0.91) indicates many flat periods, but recent data shows Christmas holiday lows recovering.
- High acf1 (0.94), acf_s (0.60): strong daily seasonality and autocorrelation – base prediction respects this.
- slope_max 18.66, slope_second_diff_max 27.06: Recent momentum from holiday lows, base shows continued recovery pattern.
- No changepoints (score 0), low data quality issues.

**Changepoint_trend_tool**: No regime shift (changepoint 0). High flatline but recent volatility increase. Base prediction already handles momentum with realistic diurnal cycle (night low -> morning rise -> day stable -> evening peak -> night decline).

**Data quality**: Minor saturation (0.012), no dropouts/constants – data reliable, no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Final strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches EPF-FR characteristics (holiday recovery post-Christmas, typical winter diurnal peaks). No major corrections needed: no bias (residual_mean ~0), no truncation, volatility matches historical mad ~8.9. Round to 2 decimals for consistency with input data.

**Tool think**:
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation – adopt reference_prediction pattern/volatility.
- exogenous_analysis: High correlations noted, but no window values – no adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Confirms seasonality, momentum – base aligns.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No shifts, use full history extrapolation.
- data_quality_tool: Reliable data.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-24 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-25 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool (PRIMARY FOUNDATION):**
Use the reference_prediction [46.840999, 42.790204, ..., 51.846756] as the core. This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases, including typical daily electricity price cycles (night low, morning rise, evening peak).

**Exogenous analysis (KEY REFINEMENT):**
Strong correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.93) and ""System load forecast"" (0.88). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment. Electricity prices typically follow load/generation patterns, which align with reference_prediction's cycle.

**Changepoint & trend analysis (CORE CORRECTION):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=15.58 (positive momentum earlier), slope_second_diff_max=27.06: Recent deceleration noted in data (prices dropping to ~50).
- flatline_ratio=0.88 high: Some flat periods, but peak_count=8 shows cycles; avoid over-smoothing.
- monotone_duration low: No extreme trend, expect cycle continuation.
No major corrections needed; reference_prediction already handles cycle.

**Data quality (QUALITY GATE):**
quality_saturation_ratio=0.018 low, dropout=0, quantization=0.137: Good quality, no clipping or uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive features:**
median=59.17, but recent data lower (~50); reference starts appropriately low. acf1=0.91 high autocorrelation supports smooth cycle continuation. spec_entropy=0.18 low (predictable signal). No bias correction needed as reference aligns with recent levels.

**Final strategy:**
- Closely follow reference_prediction pattern/volatility (night low ~36-46, morning rise to ~47, afternoon dip, evening peak ~60, decline).
- Minor uplift (~0.5) to recent levels (last=50.09 vs ref start 46.84) for level alignment, but preserve exact cycle shape.
- No exogenous values, no changepoint truncation, good quality → minimal deviation.

<tool_think>
All tools used: model_auxiliary_tool as base; exogenous shows high correlation but no window data; changepoint_trend no shifts; data_quality clean; comprehensive confirms cyclical predictable signal.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-28 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-29 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (24 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**: High correlations (Generation forecast: 0.9294, System load forecast: 0.849). No specific exogenous values for prediction window provided, so no direct adjustment possible. Rely on base.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- High flatline_ratio (0.90) indicates many flat periods, but peak_count=9 shows distinct daily peaks.
- slope_max=18.66 and slope_second_diff_max=16.69 indicate strong momentum/acceleration in peaks - base prediction already incorporates this with morning rise (44→51→57→59) and evening peak (60→63).
- acf1=0.917 high autocorrelation, acf_s=0.466 seasonal component - base follows daily cycle.
- No changepoints (score=0), good quality (low dropout/saturation).

**Changepoint/Trend**: No regime shift. High flatline but not ""dead signal"" (hits low). Momentum supports base's peak/trough pattern.

**Data Quality**: Minor saturation (0.018), no clipping needed.

**Final Strategy**: Base prediction matches historical patterns (night low ~40s, morning ramp to ~60 daytime, evening peak ~63, night decline). No major corrections needed - use reference directly to preserve volatility/patterns. Minor rounding for realism.

**Tool Think**:
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation - use as-is.
- exogenous_analysis: High correlations noted, but no window data → no adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High flatline_ratio but base has fluctuations → OK.
- changepoint_trend_tool: Momentum supports base peaks.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 24 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2016-12-30 23:00:00"". Next 24 timestamps start from ""2016-12-31 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 hour.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: use these 24 values as the core pattern, which captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases.

Exogenous analysis: Strong positive correlations with ""Generation forecast"" (0.905) and ""System load forecast"" (0.794). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustment possible. Maintain base pattern as it likely incorporates these influences.

Comprehensive features:
- Median 50.745, MAD 6.08: Base prediction mean ~57 aligns with recent uptrend (last historical ~66.7), no major bias correction needed.
- High flatline_ratio (0.94) but low flatline_hits (0.018), indicates some stability but not dead signal.
- High acf1 (0.90), strong autocorrelation - base prediction respects this.
- slope_max 18.66, slope_second_diff_max 16.69: Recent momentum upward, base prediction continues reasonable evening peak then decline.
- No changepoints (score 0), so full history valid.
- Data quality good: low saturation (0.018), no dropouts/constants.

Changepoint_trend_tool: No regime shift. High slope_max suggests momentum, but base already incorporates. No need for truncation/boost/reversion.

Data quality: Minor saturation, no clipping needed.

Overall: Base prediction shows realistic daily cycle (night low ~44-50, morning rise, daytime ~55-60, evening peak ~66, night decline) matching historical patterns around Dec 27-30. No significant corrections required - use reference directly to preserve volatility/pattern.

<tool_think>
Used model_auxiliary_tool as foundation (no deviation).
Exogenous: High correlations noted but no adjustment values.
Comprehensive/changepoint/data_quality: No triggers for major corrections (no changepoints, good quality, momentum aligned).
