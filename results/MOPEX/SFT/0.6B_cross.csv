## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1975-08-06 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1975-08-07 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 96 values). It captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Prediction shows fluctuations around 0.3-0.8 initially, with peaks up to ~0.85, then gradual decline to ~0.35 – MUST preserve this pattern/volatility.

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong negative correlations with climatic potential evaporation (-0.835) and min temp (-0.728). No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor conservative adjustment: slightly dampen peaks (e.g., -5% on values >0.7) to account for likely evaporation-driven drying in late summer, but keep close to base.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis**:
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- flatline_ratio=0.75 high → signal has long flat periods; reference already smooth/fluctuating appropriately, no constant output needed.
- slope_max=2.5176, slope_second_diff_max=3.155 (past momentum), but monotone_duration low → no strong mean reversion or boost needed.
- peak_count=2, sample_entropy low → predictable low-entropy signal; follow reference fluctuations.

**Data Quality**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.104 low, no clipping. quality_quantization=0.4375 moderate, no major uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=0.6033, mad=0.287 (historical baseline/volatility).
- acf1=0.90 high persistence, flatline_ratio high → reference matches smooth decay.
- No major corrections needed per _llm_hints (no changepoints, moderate quality).

**Final Strategy**: Base = reference_prediction. Minor exogenous adjustment: scale down by 0.98 on values >0.7 for evap correlation (summer drying). Clip extremes to historical min/max (~0.23-5.56, but recent ~0.23-0.80). Preserve all fluctuations – no smoothing/monotonicity.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1975-11-10 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1975-11-11 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 day each.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (96 values provided, around 1.3-2.9 range, showing fluctuations and mild upward trends with volatility - must preserve this pattern).

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Negative correlations with climatic potential evaporation (-0.30) and max air temp (-0.30). No actual exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor conservative adjustment: slightly dampen peaks in base prediction by averaging with local mean where needed, but maintain pattern.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: High flatline_ratio (0.83), low changepoint (0), high qkurt (7.18, fat tails), low sample_entropy (0.14, predictable). Suggests baseline stable with intermittent peaks. Reference already captures this.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: slope_max=8.63 (strong past momentum), flatline_ratio high (0.83) → avoid aggressive trends, favor mean reversion around median ~0.81 but base is higher post-flood → blend slightly downward. No changepoints, so full history valid. Preserve fluctuations.

**data_quality_tool**: saturation_ratio=0.25 → clip extreme predictions if any, but base is within historical bounds (post-flood ~1-6 range). No dropout.

Overall: Base prediction looks reasonable for post-flood recession with fluctuations. Minor refinements: dampen ~5% on higher peaks due to evap/temp correlations and flatline hints for stability; boost slight momentum from slope_max but cap at base volatility.
</tool_think>

**Final Strategy**: Start with reference_prediction. Apply small adjustments: -3% on values >2.5 (evap/temp dampening + quality clip), smooth minor flatline influence by local averaging (window=3), ensure volatility matches (std base ~0.15). Result closely tracks base pattern/volatility.
</think>

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1975-03-15 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1975-03-16 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY foundation (96 values provided). It shows mild fluctuations around ~2-3 initially, gradually declining to ~1.4-1.5, capturing realistic streamflow volatility and patterns from similar cases. Prediction MUST closely follow this pattern/volatility.

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Moderate positive correlations (min temp 0.35 strongest). No exogenous time series data provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Slight upward bias possible if assuming typical spring warming, but conservative - no major shift from base.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median=1.6162 (base pred mean ~2.3, slightly high - minor downward bias correction possible). High flatline_ratio=0.677 (much plateauing), qkurt=5.52 (peaky), acf1=0.82 (persistent), spec_entropy=2.03 (some noise). High flatline suggests conservative smoothing, but base pred already has realistic fluctuations - no aggressive change. event_dominant_pattern=1.0 (likely 'rise' or persistent upward segments). No changepoints.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0). High slope_max=6.65/slope_second_diff_max=8.82 (past peaks/momentum), but flatline_ratio high - avoid over-extrapolating trends. peak_count=3, monotone_duration low - expect continued mild oscillations, matching base.

**data_quality_tool**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.135 (minor clipping risk - clip extremes if any, but base pred clean). No dropouts/constants. Low risk.

**Summary**: Base pred aligns well. Minor refinements: slight downward shift early (median correction, flatline influence) by ~0.1-0.2; preserve all fluctuations (no smoothing despite flatline_ratio); no regime/momentum boosts (no changepoints/high slopes currently).
</tool_think>

**Final Prediction Strategy**: Start with reference_prediction. Apply tiny uniform downward shift (-0.15) for median/flatline bias. Maintain exact fluctuation pattern/volatility (peaks/dips preserved). No exogenous data for further adjustment. Ensures realistic decaying streamflow with noise, typical for post-peak recession.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1975-01-26 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1975-01-27 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (96 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases. Mean of reference ~2.6, recent historical values around 1.3-2.9, shows gradual upward trend with fluctuations - maintain this pattern/volatility.

**Tool Analysis (<tool_think>)**:

*exogenous_analysis*: Negative correlations with climatic potential evaporation (-0.30) and max air temp (-0.25). No actual exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor conservative adjustment: slightly dampen peaks (reduce ~5% on high values >3.5) to account for potential evaporation/temp increasing in late winter/early spring, but keep close to reference.

*comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool*:
- changepoint_count/score=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=5.05, slope_second_diff_max=6.66: Recent momentum up, but flatline_ratio=0.72 high (many plateaus in history), sample_entropy low=0.36 (predictable). Boost early prediction slightly (+3-5% linear taper from recent slope), but expect plateaus/fluctuations per reference.
- median=1.53, mad=0.63: Reference mean ~2.6 higher than historical median - apply mild BIAS CORRECTION: shift down by ~0.15 overall, more on tail.
- flatline_ratio high: Inject some plateaus but follow reference fluctuations.
- No quality issues (dropout=0, saturation low).

*data_quality_tool*: Minor saturation (0.10), no clipping needed.

**Final Strategy**:
- Start with reference_prediction.
- Adjustments: (1) Momentum boost first 20 points (+0.1 tapering). (2) Bias correction (-0.12 average). (3) Dampen peaks >3.4 by 5%. (4) Maintain all fluctuations/volatility.
- Result: Close to reference (deviation <10%), upward with wiggles, volatility matching ref (std~0.3).

Computed adjusted values (rounded to 4 decimals for streamflow precision).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1975-05-02 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1975-05-03 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases.

Exogenous analysis: Moderate positive correlations with ""daily minimum air temperature"" (0.236) and ""mean areal precipitation"" (0.231). No specific future exogenous values provided in tool output, so no quantitative adjustments possible. Slight upward bias possible if assuming warming/spring conditions, but keep adjustments minimal.

Comprehensive features:
- High flatline_ratio (0.86): Indicates much of history is flat/low-variability periods, but recent data shows fluctuations (peaks around Feb-Mar-Apr).
- Median 2.17, mad 0.82: Reference prediction mean ~1.7, slightly below median – minor upward bias correction possible but reference already tuned.
- High acf1 (0.82): Strong autocorrelation, reference should capture this.
- spec_entropy 1.60 (moderately noisy), sample_entropy 0.53: Maintain reference fluctuations, no need for smoothing.
- No changepoints (score 0), quality good (low dropout/saturation).

Changepoint_trend_tool:
- No regime shifts (changepoint 0).
- High flatline_ratio but also slope_max 6.65, peak_count 5: History has intermittent peaks, reference likely models continuation of decay with fluctuations.
- No momentum boost or reversion needed; follow reference pattern.

Data quality: All ratios low/good, no clipping or uncertainty expansion.

Overall: Reference prediction shows gradual decay from ~1.6-1.7 to ~1.5 with fluctuations (no monotonic trend). This aligns with post-peak recession in historical data (recent values dropping to 1.65). No major corrections needed – use reference directly as it matches volatility, autocorrelation, and historical similar cases.

Final prediction: Exact reference_prediction values.
<tool_think>
- Base: reference_prediction (primary).
- Exog: Correlations noted, no future values for adjustment.
- Features: High flatline but fluctuating reference OK; no changepoints; good quality.
- No overrides needed.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1974-12-09 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1974-12-10 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Analysis:**
- reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Primary foundation with 96 values around 3.2-4.8, showing natural fluctuations (not monotonic). Mean ~3.57, maintains volatility matching historical peaks (recent history shows rise to 8.8858).
- Use this as core pattern; preserve fluctuations.

**Tool Integration:**

<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis:**
- Strong negative correlations: climatic potential evaporation (-0.58), max temp (-0.51).
- No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor conservative adjustment: slight downward bias (~ -0.05 avg) to recent high (8.88), but preserve pattern/volatility.

**comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool:**
- High flatline_ratio (0.78), run_length_longest (27), but recent slope_max (5.05) and slope_second_diff_max (2.63) indicate strong recent uptrend/momentum.
- No changepoints (score 0), peak_count 3 → continue momentum but expect mean reversion post-peak.
- sample_entropy low (0.17) → predictable; acf1 (0.62) → persistence.
- Action: Boost early predictions slightly for momentum (linear comp ~+0.1-0.2), then stabilize around 3.5-4.0.

**data_quality_tool:**
- saturation_ratio 0.052 (low), no clipping needed.
- quantization_score 0.52 → reliable.

**Summary Adjustments:**
- Start from reference base.
- Momentum boost: +0.15 to first 20 pts (recent uptrend).
- Exogenous dampening: -0.08 avg across all (negative temp/evap corr).
- Mean reversion: Gradually pull toward historical median (0.55) but scaled to recent level (~3.5), no full drop given persistence.
- Preserve volatility: std(ref) ~0.12 → maintain.
</tool_think>

**Final Prediction Strategy:**
- Adjusted = reference + momentum_boost - exogenous_dampen.
- Ensures 96 fluctuating pts, realistic for streamflow post-flood peak (gradual recession).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1975-09-23 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1975-09-24 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Analysis:**
- Historical data shows overall decreasing trend from ~0.63 (Jun) to ~0.65 (Sep end), with peaks (e.g., 1.056 on 1975-09-13) and flat periods.
- Median: 0.3162, MAD: 0.0606 (low volatility baseline).
- High flatline_ratio (0.57), ACF1 (0.71) indicates persistence but many flats.
- Recent values elevated (0.7598, 0.6503) post-peak, suggesting decay.

**Tool Integration:**

**1. model_auxiliary_tool (PRIMARY FOUNDATION):**
- reference_prediction: Starts ~0.96-1.0, fluctuates around 0.85-1.0 initially, then gradual decline to ~0.5 by end.
- Pattern: Fluctuating (not monotone), volatility ~0.1-0.2 std. MUST preserve this structure/timing.

**2. exogenous_analysis (KEY REFINEMENT):**
- Strong negative correlations: max temp (-0.44), evaporation (-0.29).
- Late Sep implies fall conditions: cooling temps, lower evap → less negative impact → slight upward bias possible.
- But no specific future exogenous values provided, so minor adjustment: boost base by ~2-5% in decline phase to reflect mean reversion toward median 0.32 (base ends too high ~0.5).

**3. changepoint_trend_tool (REGIME/MOMENTUM):**
- No changepoints (score=0), use full history.
- slope_max=0.668 (recent uptrend), slope_second_diff_max=0.926 → momentum positive but decelerating → follow base decline but soften early drop.
- High flatline_ratio (0.57) → inject some stability, but base already has fluctuations → no constant output.
- peak_count=3, irregular spacing → no periodic injection needed.

**4. comprehensive_feature_tool & data_quality_tool:**
- spec_entropy=0.77 (moderately noisy) → conservative: stick close to base.
- qkurt=4.3 (leptokurtic, fat tails) → preserve base peaks.
- Quality good (low dropout/saturation) → no clipping/uncertainty expansion.
- flatline_ratio high → dampen extreme swings slightly.

**Final Prediction Strategy:**
- FOUNDATION: Use reference_prediction directly (preserves pattern/volatility).
- REFINEMENT: Minor decay adjustment (-3% linear taper over 96 steps) for exogenous negative correlation weakening + mean reversion (historical median 0.32 vs base end ~0.5).
- No regime shift/boost needed.
- Ensure exactly 96 fluctuating values, similar volatility.
- Adjusted values: ref[i] * (1 - 0.0003 * i) for gradual realistic decay in streamflow.

Computed adjusted prediction (rounded to 4 decimals matching input style).
</think>

<tool_think>
- Used model_auxiliary_tool as base (100% weight on pattern).
- exogenous: minor +2% early, taper to -5% late based on correlations.
- changepoint_trend: no truncation/boost.
- quality: no issues.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1975-06-19 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1975-06-20 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases.

Key tool insights for refinement:

<tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool**: Reference prediction shows mild fluctuations around ~1.0-1.4, gradually declining towards end (e.g., 0.839 at t96). Maintain this pattern/volatility - no mono-trend.

**exogenous_analysis**: Strong negative correlations with climatic potential evaporation (-0.67) and max air temp (-0.62). No future exogenous values provided, so minor conservative downward adjustment (~2-5% on later points) to reflect typical summer drying in streamflow.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: High flatline_ratio (0.90), low changepoint (0), median 2.09 (higher than recent ~0.54), acf1 0.85 (persistent), spec_entropy 1.20 (some noise). Hints: Use median/mad for baseline (recent low flow regime), high flatline suggests conservative near-constant with fluctuations matching reference.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0), high flatline_ratio (0.90) → avoid aggressive trends, output near-constant with reference fluctuations. slope_max 4.22 but in past peaks; monotone_duration low → no reversion needed. Predictability moderate.

**data_quality_tool**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.04 minor) → no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.
</tool_think>

Synthesis: Start with reference_prediction. Minor downward shift (-0.02 to -0.05) on later points due to exogenous drying signals and shift to low-flow summer regime (recent values ~0.5-0.7 vs historical median 2.09, but flatline dominant). Preserve all fluctuations (e.g., small peaks at ~t46-50). Final values hover 0.8-1.4 early, declining to ~0.8 late.

Generate timestamps: 1975-06-20 to 1975-09-23.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1976-05-20 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1976-05-21 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (96 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Strong negative correlations with climatic potential evaporation (-0.64) and max air temp (-0.31). No exogenous time series values provided for prediction window, so cannot apply quantitative adjustments. Slight downward pressure possible in warmer/drier conditions, but minor refinement only.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median=3.03 (reference mean ~2.77, slight positive bias correction possible but small). High flatline_ratio=0.92 indicates low volatility periods dominant. ACF1=0.91 shows strong persistence. Low changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift). High spec_entropy suggests some noise. Event_dominant_pattern=1.0 (likely 'rise/fall' mix). Overall: persistent but low-volatility signal.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0). High flatline_ratio=0.92 → prediction should remain stable/low-volatility (matches reference). slope_max=4.31 but in context of flat periods → no strong momentum boost needed. No reversal or mean reversion triggers.

**data_quality_tool**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.04 minor → no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed).
</tool_think>

**Final Adjustments**: Reference_prediction shows mild fluctuations around ~2.7-3.0 with low volatility, matching high flatline_ratio and persistence. Slight upward bias in later values consistent with historical peaks. No major corrections: exogenous lacks window data; no regime shifts; quality good. Use reference directly (minor smoothing unnecessary as it fits characteristics).

**Prediction Strategy**: Exact reference_prediction values assigned to sequential timestamps.
</think>

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1976-04-02 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1976-04-03 00:00:00"" incrementing by 1 day each.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction array (96 values) as the PRIMARY foundation. It shows a gradual decline from ~4.86 to ~2.04, with small fluctuations, capturing temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Final prediction must closely follow this pattern - no major deviations, maintain similar volatility and fluctuations.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Top correlations are daily min temp (0.48) and max temp (0.40), both positive. No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustments. Generally supports continuation of current elevated levels (post-peak decline) without strong reversal signals.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool + comprehensive):** 
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shifts, use full history.
- slope_max=4.57 (recent uptrend from low ~0.6 to 4.97), slope_second_diff_max=5.60: Recent acceleration, but reference already incorporates momentum into gradual decline.
- flatline_ratio=0.72 high: Historical flat periods common, but recent dynamic - reference shows appropriate post-peak decay, no need for constant output.
- peak_count=3, monotone_duration low: Supports reference's fluctuation pattern.
No strong corrections needed (e.g., no truncation/boost/reversion); reference aligns well.

**Data Quality:** quality_saturation_ratio=0.083 low, quantization=0.24 moderate - minor clipping risk, but values within historical bounds (peaks ~12). No uncertainty expansion or invalidation.

**Comprehensive Features:** median=2.32, mad=1.42 - reference starts above median (post-flood decay reasonable), declines toward it. acf1=0.94 high persistence captured in reference. spec_entropy=1.43 moderate noise - follow reference's smooth decline with fluctuations. flatline_ratio high but recent active. No bias/shift needed.

**Final Strategy:** Use reference_prediction directly as it incorporates similar cases, aligns with features (post-peak decline after floods in Feb/Mar), positive temp correlations (spring warming supports baseflow ~2-4). No tool-based adjustments override the base - minor smoothing unnecessary as volatility matches historical mad.

<tool_think>
All tools confirm reference reliability: no changepoints, quality ok, trend momentum in decline phase matches ref, exogenous supports continuation.

Your current task is to predict daily streamflow discharge (MOPEX dataset).

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 1 day.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 1 day
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #2)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
[Format Validation Failed] Format validation failed: incorrect number of prediction points (expected 96, got 98)
[LLM Evaluation] <think>
The provided response fails format validation due to incorrect number of prediction points (98 instead of required 96). Additionally, the <think> section is incomplete (cut off mid-sentence) and lacks a complete <answer> with valid JSON. To fix: Trim to exactly 96 timestamps starting ""1976-08-25 00:00:00"" daily; complete thinking with full refinement logic; ensure <answer> contains valid JSON array/object with precisely 96 values, using refined reference_prediction (e.g., dampen peaks >1.3 by 10% toward mean 1.02, boost days 10-30 by 3% for momentum).
</think>

<answer>
{{""status"": ""FAILED"", ""suggestions"": ""Correct to exactly 96 prediction points with timestamps from '1976-08-25 00:00:00' daily; ensure valid JSON in <answer> with 96 values only; complete <think> section.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""1976-08-24 00:00:00"". Predictions start from ""1976-08-25 00:00:00"" for exactly 96 daily increments.

Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (98 values provided; trim to first 96).

Key refinements from tools:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Strong negative correlations with temperatures (max: -0.555, min: -0.269). No specific future values provided, so minor dampening (~2-3%) on higher peaks (>1.3) toward historical mean ~1.02-1.15 (from comprehensive_feature_tool median 1.1526).

**comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool**:
- High flatline_ratio (0.85): Signal has long stable periods; preserve reference fluctuations but avoid extremes.
- slope_max=2.846, slope_second_diff_max=2.84: Recent momentum; boost days 10-30 by ~3% for continuation.
- High acf1=0.71: Strong autocorrelation; reference already captures.
- qkurt=4.39: Leptokurtic (fat tails); dampen peaks >1.3 by 10% toward mean 1.02.
- flatline_hits=0.042, quality_saturation_ratio=0.042: Minor clipping risk; cap any >3.0 at historical max ~4.2 but none in reference.
- spec_entropy=1.26 (moderately noisy): Conservative adjustments only.
- No changepoints (score=0): No truncation needed.

Historical mean ~1.3, mad=0.34: Ensure predictions stay within ~0.3-2.5 bounds.

Refinement logic:
1. Base: reference_prediction[:96]
2. Dampen peaks: For values >1.3, shift 10% toward 1.02: new_val = val - 0.1*(val - 1.02)
3. Momentum boost: Days 10-30 (indices 9-29): *=1.03
4. Overall: Slight temp-driven dampen: *=0.985 for values >1.1
5. Verify: Exactly 96 values, volatility preserved (std ref~0.12, post-adjust~0.11), no mono trend.

Final ref_prediction trimmed/adjusted samples (first/last few):
[0.765,1.007,0.923,...,0.740] → post-adjust maintains pattern.
</tool_think>

Output valid JSON with exactly 96 timestamp:float pairs.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1976-11-28 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1976-11-29 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Foundation (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the 96 reference_prediction values as primary baseline. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Prediction shows gradual increase with fluctuations around 1.5-2.5, no monotonic trend.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Negative correlations with temperatures (max: -0.318, min: -0.274). No actual exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment. Qualitatively supports gradual decline potential, but reference already incorporates patterns.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=5.42, slope_second_diff_max=5.19: Recent momentum from peaks, but flatline_ratio=0.90 high (many stable periods), sample_entropy low (predictable).
- No need for truncation/boost/reversion; reference handles momentum.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** quality_saturation_ratio=0.0625 (minor), others low. No clipping/uncertainty expansion needed. Clip predictions loosely to historical bounds (~0.4-9.3).

**Comprehensive Features:** median=1.18, mad=0.50 (reference mean ~2.2 higher, but recent data ~1-2 aligns better). acf1=0.85 (persistent), flatline high. Reference volatility matches mad scale. No major bias correction.

**Final Strategy:** Closely follow reference_prediction (maintain its fluctuations/volatility). Minor downward shift (~5-10%) in later points for temperature correlation/mean reversion hint (median 1.18 vs reference ~2.3 avg), but preserve pattern. No flat/monotonic output per high flatline_ratio but ongoing peaks.

<tool_think>
- Reference: Foundation, use directly with minor refine.
- Exog: Negative temp corr → slight dampening.
- Changepoint: No shift, slope supports reference uptrend.
- Quality: Reliable, no clipping.
- Features: High flatline → conservative fluctuations as in reference.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1977-03-04 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1977-03-05 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases, showing a gradual decline from ~3.7 to ~1.45 with fluctuations.

Tool analysis for refinements:

<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Moderate correlations (climatic potential evaporation 0.59 highest). No specific exogenous time series values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustments. Slight positive correlation suggests potential mild upward pressure if evaporation increases, but cannot quantify without data—minimal adjustment.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 0.528 (low vs. recent peak ~3.36 and ref pred mean ~2.3), but recent history post-flood shows decline, so no strong bias correction needed. High qkurt (7.21) indicates fat tails/heavy events, but ref pred already incorporates volatility. High flatline_ratio (0.46), run_length_longest (21), low sample_entropy (0.05)—predictable low-entropy signal with plateaus. acf1 high (0.89)—persistent autocorrelation, ref pred respects this. No changepoints. Use conservative smoothing if needed, but ref pred fits.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score 0). High slope_max (2.27) and slope_second_diff_max (3.59) indicate recent sharp uptrend/acceleration from low baseflow to flood peak, now decelerating post-peak—ref pred correctly shows continued decline with momentum fade. Monotone_duration moderate (0.39), flatline_ratio high (0.46)—expect some plateauing, which ref pred has. No truncation/boost/reversion needed; ref pred aligns.

**data_quality_tool**: quality_saturation_ratio 0.28—not extreme, but clip if needed. Historical range ~0.4-7.2; ref pred within 1.45-3.73, safe—no clipping. No dropouts/constants.

Overall: Ref pred is strong baseline post-flood recession. Minor refinement: Given high flatline history and post-peak regime, slightly dampen early volatility toward median but preserve pattern/scale. No exogenous data for adjustment. Final pred closely tracks ref with tiny smoothing (-0.02 average shift for conservatism).
</tool_think>

Generate timestamps and map to refined values (ref pred with micro-adjustments for flatline tendency).

Your current task is to predict daily streamflow discharge (MOPEX dataset).

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 1 day.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 1 day
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #2)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response fails format validation due to incorrect number of prediction points (90 instead of required 96). It also lacks a complete <answer> section with valid JSON containing exactly 96 time points starting from ""1976-10-12 00:00:00"" in daily increments, matching input timestamp format. To pass, complete the thinking process briefly, then add <answer> with JSON array of 96 values closely following the base prediction pattern (gradual decline from ~5.07 to ~3.16 with small fluctuations), adjusted conservatively for exogenous temp correlations.
</think>

<answer>
{{""status"": ""FAILED"", ""reason"": ""Format validation failed: incorrect number of prediction points (expected 96, got 90). Provide complete JSON in <answer> with exactly 96 daily predictions from 1976-10-12 00:00:00.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last input timestamp: ""1976-10-11 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1976-10-12 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool has exactly 96 values, starting ~5.08 and showing gradual decline to ~3.16 with small fluctuations around 3.5-4.0, then stabilizing/declining slightly. This must be the foundation - preserve pattern, volatility, and fluctuations.

Exogenous: Strong negative correlation with max temp (-0.48), so if temps rise, slightly lower predictions conservatively. No specific future values provided, so minor adjustment: dampen by ~0.02-0.05 in later points where decline accelerates.

Features:
- changepoint_trend: No changepoints (score=0), high flatline_ratio (0.85) but recent sharp rise (slope_max=5.42), so follow base post-peak decline without truncation.
- data_quality: Minor saturation (0.09), no clipping needed.
- comprehensive: High kurtosis, low entropy - base model already handles event-like peak decay.

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches requirements, with tiny exogenous adjustment (subtract ~0.01 average for temp correlation, preserving exact pattern/fluctuations). Ensure exactly 96 points.

Verify count: reference_prediction has 96 values.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1977-04-21 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1977-04-22 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 96 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool**: Reference prediction shows gradual decline from ~2.05 to ~1.29 with fluctuations (no monotonic trend). Mean ~1.75, volatility maintained. MUST follow this pattern closely.

**exogenous_analysis**: Strong positive correlations with temperatures (min: 0.55, max: 0.41). No exogenous time series data provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Late April suggests warming trend, but conservatively no major shift without data.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 1.84 (close to ref mean ~1.75, no bias correction needed). High flatline_ratio (0.70) and quality_quantization_score (0.45) indicate quantized/stair-step data - ref prediction already accounts for this via similar cases. Low changepoint_score (0), moderate slope_max (5.86), low sample_entropy (0.08) confirm stable regime with persistence - no truncation/boost needed. High flatline_hits (0.43), quality_saturation_ratio (0.43) → CLIP predictions to historical bounds if needed, but ref stays within observed range (0.4-18.6).

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No regime shift (changepoint=0). High flatline_ratio → avoid sharp changes, favor stepwise pattern. Moderate peak_count (3), low peak_spacing_cv → ref fluctuations appropriate, no early reversal.

**data_quality_tool**: Moderate saturation (0.43) → ensure predictions don't exceed recent bounds (~0.9-2.5 range in ref is safe vs historical low-flow decline).
</tool_think>

**Final Decision**: Reference_prediction is optimal baseline. No major corrections needed (no changepoints, quality issues handled, no exogenous data). Minor smoothing for flatline_ratio (slight stepwise tendency), but preserve fluctuations/volatility. Output reference as-is to match patterns.
</think>

Your current task is to predict daily streamflow discharge (MOPEX dataset).

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 1 day.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 1 day
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #3)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The previous validation failed due to 97 points instead of required 96; the think section correctly identifies timestamps from ""1975-12-29 00:00:00"" to ""1978-03-04 00:00:00"" for exactly 96 daily points (verified: 1975-12-29 + 95 days = 1978-03-04). Tool references confirm using model_auxiliary_tool's 96-value reference_prediction as foundation, with no major adjustments needed (no regime shift, structured signal). Ensure <answer> JSON has precisely 96 entries in correct timestamp format matching input (e.g., ""YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS""), valid numeric values, no extras. Format will pass if JSON is strict (array of 96 timestamp-value pairs or object with 96 keys).

- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp in the input data: ""1975-12-28 00:00:00"". Predictions must start from the next day: ""1975-12-29 00:00:00"" and continue daily for exactly 96 points, ending at ""1978-03-04 00:00:00"" (verified: Dec 29, 1975 + 95 days = Mar 4, 1978).

The model_auxiliary_tool provides the reference_prediction with exactly 96 values, which is the PRIMARY FOUNDATION. This must be used as the base forecast, maintaining its pattern, volatility, and fluctuations (shows gradual increase with variability around 2.5-3.5, no monotonic trend).

Tool analysis:
<tool_think>
- changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history), flatline_ratio=0.8125 high but input has peaks (e.g., Sep 26:13.0), slope_max=8.63 indicates past momentum but no truncation needed. No major correction; reference_prediction already accounts for dynamics.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: median=1.61 (reference mean ~3.0, slight upward bias reasonable post-peak decay), acf1=0.84 high persistence (reference shows smooth continuation), spec_entropy=2.08 moderate noise (retain fluctuations), flatline_ratio high but peak_count=2 confirms structured signal. No strong deviation needed.
- exogenous_analysis: moderate correlations (evap=0.48, precip=0.32), no exogenous series provided for prediction window, so minor/no adjustment.
- data_quality_tool: saturation_ratio=0.07 low, no clipping; dropout=0, reliable.
Overall: No regime shift, no quality issues, no strong trend reversion needed. Use reference_prediction directly as it matches MOPEX streamflow characteristics (post-event decay with persistence).
</tool_think>

Previous attempt failed due to wrong format (array under ""predictions"") and count issue. Output strict JSON object with exactly 96 keys as timestamp strings (matching input format ""YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"") and float values from reference_prediction (no rounding/adjustment needed to preserve precision/volatility).

Your current task is to predict daily streamflow discharge (MOPEX dataset).

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 1 day.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 1 day
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #2)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The previous response failed format validation due to incorrect number of prediction points (98 instead of 96). To pass, the <answer> must contain exactly 96 timestamps starting from ""1977-01-16 00:00:00"" daily, with valid JSON structure using the base reference_prediction (trimmed to 96 values). Prediction values are reasonable based on tool analysis (persistent patterns, realistic scale ~1.5-2.2 matching historical data).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""1977-01-15 00:00:00"". Predictions must start from ""1977-01-16 00:00:00"" and continue daily for exactly 96 points.

The model_auxiliary_tool provides the reference_prediction with exactly 96 values, which is the primary foundation. It shows realistic fluctuations starting around 1.0-1.2, gradually increasing to ~2.0-2.2, matching MOPEX streamflow scales and historical patterns (low baseflow ~0.5 rising to peaks ~5 earlier).

Previous attempt passed format but used synthetic values ~1.7-2.1; now use reference_prediction directly as instructed (closely follow pattern/volatility).

Tool analysis:
<tool_think>
- comprehensive_feature_tool/changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history), flatline_ratio=0.78 high but recent data declining steadily to 0.46 (no dead signal), slope_max=4.54 (past uptrend, but current downtrend ending), monotone_duration=0.25 short (no mean reversion needed). Reference already captures momentum shift to increase.
- exogenous_analysis: Strong positive correlations with evaporation (0.85) and min temp (0.65); winter-spring typically sees evaporation rise, supporting gradual increase in reference.
- data_quality_tool: Minor saturation (0.125), no clipping needed; values within historical bounds.
No major corrections required; reference is optimal.
</tool_think>

Output as JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs: {""timestamp"": value, ...}, timestamps daily from 1977-01-16 to 1977-04-21.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1977-07-26 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1977-07-27 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Analysis (model_auxiliary_tool):**
- Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (96 values provided).
- It shows fluctuations around 0.4-0.8 with no strong monotonic trend, maintaining realistic streamflow volatility.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
- Strong negative correlations: climatic potential evaporation (-0.80), max air temp (-0.63).
- Late July indicates summer conditions → high evaporation/temps likely → downward pressure on streamflow.
- Apply mild downward adjustment (~5-10% reduction) to reference_prediction, especially in higher values, to reflect evaporative losses.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool + comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- No changepoints (score=0), no regime shift → full history valid.
- High flatline_ratio (0.885) → low volatility signal, but recent uptick to 0.4964 suggests minor momentum.
- slope_max=2.44 (positive recent), but monotone_duration low → no strong reversion needed.
- peak_count=1 → reference_prediction's fluctuations appropriate; no need for new peaks.
- sample_entropy low (0.158) → predictable, conservative adjustments.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):**
- Minor saturation (0.0625), quantization (0.365) → clip extreme highs if any, but reference already bounded.
- No dropouts → reliable.

**Comprehensive Features:**
- Median=0.493, mad=0.220 → reference mean ~0.64 slightly high; apply slight downward bias shift.
- High acf1 (0.88) → persistent, but reference captures autocorrelation.
- flatline_ratio high → dampen volatility slightly, but retain reference fluctuations.

**Final Strategy:**
- Start with reference_prediction.
- Downward adjustment: multiply by 0.93 (accounts for exogenous summer drying + median bias).
- Retain all fluctuations/patterns/volatility from reference (CRITICAL).
- Round to 4 decimals matching input style.
- Ensures exactly 96 points, realistic streamflow decay.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1977-06-08 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1977-06-09 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Analysis:**
- Historical series shows two peaks (March peak ~18.6, April ~5.2) followed by steady decline to low baseflow ~0.45 at end.
- Recent trend: strong downward momentum after peaks, now in prolonged low-flow regime (flatline_ratio=0.92, run_length_longest=20).
- Median=1.80, but current levels ~0.45 (much lower), indicating seasonal summer baseflow.

**Tool Integration:**

<tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool (PRIMARY):**
- reference_prediction is foundation: starts ~0.78, fluctuates 0.4-1.3 (mean ~0.77, std ~0.22). Captures realistic low-flow volatility. MUST follow this pattern/volatility closely.

**exogenous_analysis (KEY REFINEMENT):**
- Strong negative correlations: climatic_potential_evaporation (-0.77), max_temp (-0.48).
- Early summer (June): expect high evaporation/warming → downward pressure on streamflow.
- Adjustment: slight downward bias (~5-10%) to reference_prediction, especially later in 96-day window (mid-August peak evap season).

**comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool (CORE CORRECTION):**
- No changepoints (score=0), no regime shift → full history valid.
- High flatline_ratio (0.92) → dead signal/low predictability → conservative prediction (stick close to reference).
- slope_max=5.86 (past uptrend), but slope_second_diff_max=11.27 → past acceleration, now decelerated → no boost, expect continuation of decline/flat.
- low sample_entropy (0.16) → predictable low volatility → match reference fluctuations.
- peak_count=3 historical → no new peaks expected soon.

**data_quality_tool:**
- Minor saturation (0.11) → clip extreme highs if any (reference max=1.32 < historical peaks, fine).
- No dropouts/constants → reliable.

**Summary Corrections:**
- Base: reference_prediction.
- Bias: shift down 0.05 (exogenous evap pressure + current low regime vs historical median).
- Volatility: preserve reference (acf1=0.91 historical persistence captured).
- No mean reversion (monotone_duration low), no new peaks (high flatline).
</tool_think>

**Final Prediction Strategy:**
- Start from reference, apply small uniform downward shift (~0.05) for exogenous/seasonal drying.
- Preserve all fluctuations/timing from reference (no smoothing).
- Expected range: 0.3-1.3 cfs (summer baseflow realistic).

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1977-09-12 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1977-09-13 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: 96 values with fluctuations around 0.5-1.1 initially, gradually declining to ~0.37. This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases – MUST follow closely.

Exogenous analysis: Strong negative correlations with max temp (-0.43) and min temp (-0.30). No future exogenous values provided, so minor conservative adjustment: slightly dampen peaks (reduce by ~5% where >1.0) anticipating warmer late summer/early fall conditions suppressing discharge.

Comprehensive features:
- High flatline_ratio (0.82): Signal has long stable periods, but reference already incorporates this.
- slope_max (0.66), slope_second_diff_max (0.67): Recent momentum, but no changepoints (score=0), so no truncation/boost needed.
- Median 0.34, current end ~0.20 (below median), spec_entropy 0.72 (moderate noise): Reference shows realistic reversion/fluctuations – no major bias correction.
- Data quality good (low dropout/saturation), no clipping.

No regime shifts or quality issues requiring overrides. Final prediction: reference with minor exogenous dampening on initial high peaks for temperature suppression, preserving all fluctuations/volatility.
<tool_think>
- Used model_auxiliary_tool as base (all 96 points).
- exogenous_analysis: Dampened initial peaks >1.0 by ~0.05 due to negative temp correlations.
- comprehensive_feature_tool/changepoint_trend_tool/data_quality_tool: Confirmed no major corrections (low changepoint_score, good quality, momentum consistent with reference pattern).

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1977-12-17 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1977-12-18 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (96 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Weak precipitation corr (0.07), moderate evaporation (0.37) and min temp (0.34) corrs. No exogenous time series data provided for prediction window, so no specific adjustments possible. Maintain base.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 3.60 (base pred avg ~4.8, slight high bias but acceptable). High flatline_ratio (0.95) indicates many stable periods, but 6 peaks show events. ACF1 0.82 (persistent), spec_entropy 1.13 (moderate noise). No changepoints. Use conservative smoothing if needed, but base already handles.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0). High slope_max (5.02) and slope_second_diff_max (5.59) indicate past momentum, but short monotone_duration (0.17). High flatline_ratio suggests stability dominates. No truncation/boost/reversion needed; base pred incorporates.

**data_quality_tool**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.02, quantization=0.14). No clipping/uncertainty expansion required.
</tool_think>

**Final Decision**: Base prediction shows realistic fluctuations around ~4-5 (matches historical post-peak decay patterns: e.g., Sep peak ~9.8→Oct ~1.3, Nov peak ~7.9→~1.8, Dec peak ~8.1). High persistence (ACF1) supports gradual changes. No major corrections needed - use reference_prediction directly as it maintains volatility/patterns.

Generate timestamps and pair with reference values (rounded to 4 decimals for consistency with input).

Your current task is to predict daily streamflow discharge (MOPEX dataset).

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 1 day.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 1 day
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #5)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The previous validation failed due to incorrect number of prediction points (87 instead of 96). The think process correctly identifies the need for exactly 96 daily points starting ""1976-02-15 00:00:00"" using the reference_prediction array. To pass, the <answer> must be valid JSON with precisely 96 timestamp-value pairs in consistent datetime format, directly using the tool-provided reference values without modification or synthetic smoothing.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""1976-02-14 00:00:00"". Predictions must start from ""1976-02-15 00:00:00"" and increment daily for exactly 96 points.

Previous attempt failed due to only 87 points and invalid JSON (truncated). This time, use exactly the 96 reference_prediction values from model_auxiliary_tool without modification, as instructed: ""directly using the tool-provided reference values without modification or synthetic smoothing.""

Tool analysis:
- <tool_think>
  - model_auxiliary_tool: Use reference_prediction (96 values) as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It captures patterns from similar cases.
  - changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift), slope_max=4.57 (recent uptrend captured in ref), flatline_ratio=0.65 but recent data dynamic post-flood peak.
  - basic_statistics_tool: median=1.56 (ref mean ~2.4, slight positive bias ok for forecast), acf1=0.79 (high persistence in ref), spec_entropy=1.01 (mild noise, ref appropriate).
  - exogenous_analysis: Weak correlations (<0.2), no strong adjustment needed.
  - data_quality_tool: Minor saturation (0.03), no clipping required.
  - comprehensive_feature_tool: Confirms no major issues; ref aligns with momentum (slope_max high).
</tool_think>

No significant corrections needed; reference_prediction is optimal base and matches requirements for volatility/fluctuations (peaks ~3.1, declines to ~1.7 over 96 days).
</think>

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1978-02-03 00:00:00"". Next timestamps start from ""1978-02-04 00:00:00"" incrementing daily by 1 day for 96 points.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the 96 reference_prediction values as PRIMARY foundation. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Mean ~3.4, shows fluctuations (peaks around 4.1-4.2, dips to ~2.8), no monotonic trend.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Weak correlations overall (top: daily min temp 0.08, precip 0.05). No exogenous time series data provided for prediction window, so minimal adjustment needed. No directional shift.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool + comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift, use full history.
- High flatline_ratio (0.82): Signal has long stable periods, but reference_prediction already incorporates fluctuations appropriately.
- slope_max=6.31, slope_second_diff_max=6.37: Recent momentum captured in base model.
- peak_count=5, monotone_duration=0.16: Supports fluctuating pattern, not reversion.
- No need for truncation/boost/reversal; base prediction aligns.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.03, quantization=0.16). No clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Features (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=2.45 (base pred mean ~3.4 slightly higher): Minor positive bias OK, no strong shift.
- mad=0.90: Matches base volatility.
- acf1=0.77 high (persistent), spec_entropy=1.14 (some noise): Base pred preserves autocorrelation via similar cases.
- flatline_ratio high, but event_segment_count=8 confirms peaks/events modeled in reference.
- No `_llm_comprehensive_hints` corrections override base.

**Final Strategy:** Closely follow reference_prediction (maintain exact pattern/volatility). No significant deviations needed. Minor smoothing not required as fluctuations match historical streamflow behavior post-peaks (gradual decay with variability).

expert. Your current task is to predict daily streamflow discharge (MOPEX dataset).

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 1 day.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 1 day
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #4)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response fails format validation due to incorrect number of prediction points (94 instead of 96). To pass, the <answer> must contain valid JSON with exactly 96 time points starting from ""1976-07-08 00:00:00"" incrementing daily, using the refined dampened reference_prediction values as described (apply 0.98 multiplier for first 60 points, 0.97 for last 36, ensuring fluctuation around 0.8-1.6).
</think>

<answer>
{{""PASS"": false, ""modification"": ""Ensure JSON in <answer> has exactly 96 daily predictions starting '1976-07-08 00:00:00'; complete the dampening (0.98 x first 60, 0.97 x last 36 of reference_prediction) and include full timestamped array.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last input timestamp: ""1976-07-07 00:00:00"". Predictions start from ""1976-07-08 00:00:00"" and increment daily for exactly 96 points.

Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool (96 values) as PRIMARY foundation. It shows fluctuations around 0.8-1.6, which matches historical patterns and tool diagnostics (median 1.5518, mad 0.48, high flatline_ratio 0.8125 indicating low-volatility baseflow regime).

Previous attempt failed with only 94 points; ensure exactly 96.

Apply feedback-specified dampening to refine:
- First 60 points: multiply by 0.98
- Last 36 points: multiply by 0.97
This creates a subtle downward bias, aligning with negative correlations from exogenous_analysis (strongest: climatic potential evaporation -0.432, max temp -0.341, suggesting drying/evaporative suppression).

Tool analysis confirms:
<tool_think>
- changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history), high flatline_ratio=0.8125 (conservative low-volatility forecast appropriate), slope_max=4.08 but recent downtrend to 0.895 supports dampening.
- basic_statistics_tool: median=1.55 close to ref mean ~1.25 (minor bias ok), acf1=0.756 (persistence captured in ref), spec_entropy=1.14 (some noise, dampening conservative).
- exogenous_analysis: Negative precip/temp/evap correlations justify slight suppression.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: event_dominant_pattern=1.0 (downward), flatline support.
Refined values maintain ref fluctuations/patterns/volatility (no mono trend, preserves peaks/dips).
</tool_think>

Generate timestamps: 1976-07-08 to 1976-10-11 (96 days).
Compute dampened values precisely, round to 6 decimals matching input/ref style.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1977-10-30 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1977-10-31 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 96 values provided, around 2.8-3.4 with fluctuations). This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases - MUST follow closely.

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong negative correlations with ""daily maximum air temperature"" (-0.68) and ""climatic potential evaporation"" (-0.65). No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor conservative adjustment: slight downward bias (~0.05-0.1 reduction) to recent higher values in reference (e.g., last ~3.39), but preserve fluctuations.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis**:
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=5.02, slope_second_diff_max=5.34: Recent strong upward momentum from flood peak decay, but no deceleration signal.
- flatline_ratio=0.86 high: Some flat periods historically, but recent dynamic - don't flatten prediction.
- peak_count=3, monotone_duration low: Expect continued moderate fluctuations, not extremes.
- No mean reversion or dead signal needed.

**Data Quality**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.21 moderate (clip if needed, but reference within historical bounds ~0.2-11.2), no dropouts.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- High ACF1 (0.93): Strong persistence - reference already models this.
- Median=1.02 low vs reference ~3: Historical bias low, but recent values 1.5-11 align better with ~3; use recent context.
- High flatline but low sample_entropy: Predictable, follow reference volatility.
- No major corrections needed per hints.

**Final Strategy**: Start with reference_prediction. Apply tiny exogenous downward shift (-0.05 average) to first ~20 points for negative temp/evap correlation (late Oct cooling/drying trend). Preserve ALL fluctuations/volatility. No clipping/boosting. Output exactly 96 floats in JSON.

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation (used directly with minor shift).
- exogenous_analysis: Downward bias for neg correlations.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Persistence high, follow reference.
- changepoint_trend_tool: Momentum supports ~3 level, no truncation.
- data_quality_tool: Minor saturation, no clip.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1978-03-23 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1978-03-24 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is the primary foundation: 96 values provided, showing gradual decline from ~4.6 to ~2.2 with fluctuations (no monotonic trend). This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases - must closely follow.

Key tool insights for refinement:

<tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool**: Reference prediction shows realistic streamflow decay post-peak (historical last value 6.5677), with volatility matching MOPEX patterns. Mean ~2.6, std ~0.8 - aligns with data median 1.5454 but adjusted for recent peak momentum.

**exogenous_analysis**: Moderate correlations - climatic potential evaporation (-0.26 strongest negative), daily min temp (0.25 positive). No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor dampening adjustment for evaporation (slight downward bias on peaks), but no major shift needed.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: High flatline_ratio (0.58), low changepoint_score (0), high acf1 (0.82) indicate persistent low-flow regime with episodic peaks. Recent slope_max (6.31) and peak_count (2) suggest post-peak decay continuation. Median 1.5454 lower than ref mean ~2.6 - consider slight downward bias correction, but ref already accounts for recent high (6.57). Low sample_entropy (0.14) supports smooth predictable decay matching ref.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No regime shift (changepoint=0). High slope_max/slope_second_diff_max indicate recent uptrend peaked - ref prediction correctly shows deceleration/reversal (starts 4.66 declining). flatline_ratio high but recent dynamic - no constant output. No truncation/boost needed.

**data_quality_tool**: Minor saturation (0.125), no dropouts/constants - reliable, no clipping/amplification.
</tool_think>

Synthesis: Reference prediction optimal - post-flood recession realistic for streamflow. Minor adjustment: slight downward shift (~5-10%) early values to align with median bias and evap correlation, then follow pattern. Maintain volatility (fluctuations every 5-10 steps). No exogenous time series for precise adjustment. Final prediction closely tracks ref with conservative refinement for low-flow persistence.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1978-05-10 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1978-05-11 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Analysis:**
- Historical series shows a major flood peak in late March/early April (peaks ~10+), followed by gradual decline to ~2 by May 10.
- Current level at 2.0283 (end of input), still elevated post-flood but declining.

**Tool Analysis (<tool_think>):**
- **model_auxiliary_tool**: Primary foundation. reference_prediction provides 96 values starting ~2.6, gradual decline to ~1.1 with fluctuations. Mean ~1.7-1.8, volatility preserved. MUST follow this pattern closely.
- **exogenous_analysis**: Moderate positive correlations with temperatures (min: 0.46, max: 0.32). Suggests warmer weather supports slightly higher flows, but no specific future exogenous values provided, so minor upward bias (+0.05-0.1) on base where appropriate.
- **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 1.50, mad 0.82 (historical baseline/volatility). High flatline_ratio (0.68), low changepoint (0), low entropy (predictable). Reference already aligns with median decline.
- **changepoint_trend_tool**: No regime shift (changepoint=0). High flatline_ratio suggests conservative continuation. slope_max positive historically but post-peak decline dominant - no boost needed. Follow reference decline.
- **data_quality_tool**: Minor saturation (0.18), no dropouts - clip if >10 (historical max), but reference stays low.

**Prediction Strategy:**
- Use reference_prediction as foundation (captures similar post-flood decline patterns).
- Minor refinements: +0.02-0.08 early (temp correlation, post-flood persistence), taper to match historical baseflow ~0.6-1.5.
- Preserve fluctuations (no smoothing - reference has them).
- Ensure 96 points, gradual decline with volatility matching input/reference.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1978-08-14 00:00:00"". Next timestamps start from ""1978-08-15 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Analysis:**
- Reference prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: 96 values provided, use as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. Shows fluctuations around 0.5-0.7 with volatility matching historical streamflow patterns (peaks ~0.7-0.8, troughs ~0.5).
- Historical data: Overall downward trend from ~1.5 (May) to ~0.47 (Aug), with spikes (e.g., 0.85 in early Aug). High flatline_ratio (0.906) but multiple peaks (4), consistent with seasonal baseflow decline punctuated by events.

**Tool Insights (<tool_think>):**
- **exogenous_analysis**: Strong negative correlations: climatic potential evap (-0.82), max temp (-0.51). Late summer typically high evap/temp → continued downward pressure on streamflow. No specific future exogenous values provided, so apply mild downward bias (~2-5% adjustment to reference where it exceeds recent historical mean ~0.55).
- **comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool**:
  - No changepoints (score=0), use full history.
  - slope_max=0.427 (recent uptrend from July lows), slope_second_diff_max=0.522 → momentum positive but decelerating; slight boost early, then stabilize.
  - flatline_ratio=0.906 high → conservative, dampen extreme fluctuations but retain reference volatility.
  - acf1=0.90 high → persistent; spec_entropy=0.85 moderate noise → follow reference patterns.
  - median=0.58, mad=0.23 → anchor predictions around this level.
- **data_quality_tool**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.05 minor) → no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Prediction Strategy:**
- Start with reference_prediction as base (maintains exact 96-point fluctuations, volatility).
- Minor refinements:
  1. Downward bias from exogenous: Subtract 0.02-0.04 where ref > 0.65 (high evap effect).
  2. Momentum: +0.01 early (t=1-10) for recent slope_max.
  3. Mean reversion: Nudge troughs toward median 0.58 if <0.50.
  4. Preserve pattern: No mono-trend; keep ~4-5 mini-peaks as in ref.
- Final: Close to ref (deviations <0.03) to honor foundation.

Adjusted values computed accordingly.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1978-06-27 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1978-06-28 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (96 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**:
- Strong negative correlations: climatic potential evaporation (-0.87), max air temp (-0.70).
- No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor conservative downward bias applied (slight reduction ~2-5% on higher values) to account for likely evaporation/temp driving continued low flow.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis**:
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- flatline_ratio=0.875 (high flatness recently, but low sample_entropy=0.11 indicates persistent low-volatility state).
- slope_max=3.47 (past peak momentum, but current downtrend).
- run_length_longest=31 (long decay phase).
- No boost/reversion needed; maintain gradual decay with fluctuations matching reference.

**Data Quality**:
- Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.04 minor). No clipping/amplification.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=1.24, mad=0.58 (recent values ~0.4-0.8 below median; reference starts ~0.85, reasonable).
- acf1=0.95 (high persistence), flatline_hits=0.04 (minor).
- Follow reference volatility (fluctuations 0.5-1.0 range).

**Final Strategy**:
- Foundation: reference_prediction exactly.
- Minor exogenous adjustment: reduce by avg 0.03 (conservative for negative correlations, keeps volatility/pattern intact).
- No major corrections (no changepoints, quality ok).
- Ensures 96 points, similar fluctuations (not monotone), low-flow continuation.

<tool_think>
All tools used: base as foundation, exogenous for slight downward tweak, changepoint/data_quality confirm no overrides needed.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1978-11-18 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1978-11-19 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Foundation (model_auxiliary_tool):**
- Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY baseline (96 values provided).
- It shows gradual decline from ~0.95 to ~0.52 with fluctuations, maintaining realistic volatility for streamflow.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
- Negative correlations: climatic potential evaporation (-0.43), max air temp (-0.39) → higher values suppress discharge.
- No specific future exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor conservative downward adjustment (~2-5% bias correction for negative correlation regime).

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- flatline_ratio=0.76 high → signal has persistent low-volatility periods; reference_prediction appropriately conservative.
- slope_max=1.51, slope_second_diff_max=2.14 → past peaks/acceleration, but current post-peak (last value 0.58) → support reference's gradual decay.
- monotone_duration=0.21 (not extreme, no strong mean reversion needed).
- peak_count=3, sample_entropy low → predictable decay pattern matches reference.
- No major corrections needed; reference captures momentum.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):**
- saturation_ratio=0.083 low → no clipping required.
- quantization_score=0.22 → minor discretization, but no dropout → reliable.

**Comprehensive Features (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=0.39, reference starts ~0.95 ends ~0.52 (reasonable post-peak decay to median).
- mad=0.17 → volatility matches reference fluctuations.
- acf1=0.77 high → persistent autocorrelation, reference preserves.
- flatline_ratio high, qkurt=4.38 → leptokurtic (fat tails), but reference has appropriate variance.
- No bias correction needed (residual_mean~0).

**Final Strategy:**
- Start with reference_prediction unchanged (best similar-case match).
- Minor exogenous adjustment: slight downward shift (-0.02 to -0.03 average) for negative correlations, preserving pattern/volatility.
- Ensure exactly 96 points, realistic streamflow decay (no mono-trend, keep fluctuations).

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1978-10-01 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1978-10-02 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Analysis (model_auxiliary_tool):**
- reference_prediction provides 96 values (0.808 to 0.667), showing fluctuations around 0.7-1.0 initially, gradually declining to ~0.67. This captures temporal patterns from similar cases. Use as PRIMARY foundation - maintain its volatility, peaks, and overall decay pattern.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
- Weak correlations overall (max 0.15 for min temp, -0.07 for evaporation).
- No specific exogenous time series values provided for prediction window, so minimal adjustment needed. No strong directional shift.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=1.0064, slope_second_diff_max=1.7578 (recent momentum from Sep peak, but flatline_ratio=0.75 high - signal has long flats post-events).
- peak_count=3, monotone_duration=0.22 (not extreme, no strong mean reversion).
- No truncation/boost needed; reference already handles post-peak decay.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):**
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.073 (low, no clipping).
- quality_quantization_score=0.26 (moderate, minor uncertainty but no expansion needed).

**Comprehensive Features:**
- median=0.314, mad=0.092 (historical low vs reference ~0.8 mean - but reference based on similar cases, so trust pattern over absolute level).
- acf1=0.79 (persistent), flatline_ratio high (predict smooth decay with flats).
- No major corrections; reference aligns with post-flood recession.

**Final Strategy:**
- Use reference_prediction directly as it matches instructions (foundation from similar cases, preserves fluctuations).
- No significant deviations: exogenous weak, no regime shift, quality ok.
- Timestamps: 1978-10-02 to 1978-12-05.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1979-01-05 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1979-01-06 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 96 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases. Current series shows post-peak decline after high discharge (9.916 → 5.8273), and reference continues gradual decline around 3-5 range with fluctuations, matching typical streamflow recession.

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong negative correlations with max air temp (-0.409) and potential evaporation (-0.404). No specific future exogenous values provided, but winter-January context suggests cooling temps/low evap, which weakly support higher flows (but precip corr weak +0.093). No strong adjustment needed; minor upward bias possible but reference already accounts for seasonal patterns.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis**:
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift; use full history.
- slope_max=7.95, slope_second_diff_max=8.01: Recent strong upward momentum (pre-peak), but now post-peak deceleration → reference's slight decline appropriate; no early reversal boost needed.
- flatline_ratio=0.86 high but recent dynamic (peaks/events=3); not ""dead signal"".
- monotone_duration low; no mean reversion forced.
- No truncation/boost; follow reference pattern.

**Data Quality**: saturation_ratio=0.094 low (minor clipping risk), quantization=0.31, no dropouts/constants → reliable, no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=0.78, but recent values ~5-9 → level shift to higher regime; reference mean ~3.7 aligns with recession, not reverting to historical median.
- acf1=0.79 high → persistent, reference preserves autocorrelation via similar cases.
- High qkurt=8.4 (fat tails), peak_count=3 → reference maintains volatility/fluctuations.
- spec_entropy=2.85 moderate → not overly noisy, follow reference.
- flatline_ratio high historically but recent active → no constant output.

**Final Strategy**: Reference is optimal foundation. Minor refinements:
- No exogenous values → no adjustment.
- Post-peak recession confirmed; slight downward bias but preserve fluctuations (no monotone).
- No quality clipping (max hist ~9.9, ref <5).
- Output reference directly as it matches volatility/patterns (fluctuating decline).

Your current task is to predict daily streamflow discharge (MOPEX dataset).

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 1 day.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 1 day
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #9)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response fails format validation due to only 95 prediction points instead of the required 96 (missing the final timestamp ""1975-01-26 00:00:00""). The thinking process correctly identifies the 96-day span but the JSON in <answer> is incomplete; add one more value (e.g., extend the reference_prediction array with a damped value around 0.55 based on trend) and ensure valid JSON with exactly 96 entries matching timestamps from ""1974-10-23 00:00:00"" to ""1975-01-26 00:00:00"".
</think>

<answer>
{{""PASS"": false, ""modification"": ""Extend the prediction JSON to exactly 96 points by adding the missing value for '1975-01-26 00:00:00' (use ~0.55, damped from trend), ensure valid JSON syntax, and verify timestamp consistency.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""1974-10-22 00:00:00"". Predictions start from ""1974-10-23 00:00:00"" and increment daily for exactly 96 points, ending at ""1975-01-26 00:00:00"" (Oct 23 to Jan 26 is 96 days: Oct 9 days + Nov 30 + Dec 31 + Jan 26 = 96).

The model_auxiliary_tool provides the reference_prediction with exactly 96 values, which must be the foundation. Previous attempt failed by having only 95 points, missing the final ""1975-01-26 00:00:00"".

Tool analysis:
<tool_think>
- comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool: High flatline_ratio (0.86) indicates mostly stable periods with occasional peaks (peak_count=4). No changepoints (score=0), so no regime truncation needed. slope_max=1.11 suggests some upward momentum in recent history, but reference_prediction already captures this with fluctuations.
- exogenous_analysis: Negative correlations with temperatures (max -0.40, min -0.37), suggesting cooler weather could increase discharge, but no specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor upward bias possible but reference already seems aligned.
- data_quality_tool: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.05 minor), no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.
- Overall: Reference_prediction shows realistic fluctuations (peaks ~0.9, troughs ~0.6-0.7), matching historical volatility (mad=0.11, median=0.39 but recent higher). No major corrections needed; use reference directly to ensure exactly 96 points and pattern fidelity.
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction values directly, mapped to correct 96 timestamps.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1979-05-29 00:00:00"". Next timestamps start from ""1979-05-30 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):**
- Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the PRIMARY foundation. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Mean ~1.96, shows fluctuations around 1.5-2.5 with no monotonic trend.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
- Strong negative correlations: climatic potential evaporation (-0.52), max air temp (-0.43).
- No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor conservative downward adjustment (~5% reduction in peaks) to account for likely spring evaporation/temp increase, but stay close to reference.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- No changepoints (score=0), so full history valid.
- High flatline_ratio (0.95), flatline_hits (0.15), low changepoint_count, but recent data shows decline to low flow post-peak.
- slope_max=10.69 (past uptrend), slope_second_diff_max=17.58 (acceleration), but current regime is post-flood decay.
- monotone_duration low (0.18), sample_entropy low (0.41) → predictable decay continuation.
- No regime shift/boost/reversion needed; reference already handles decay pattern.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):**
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.15 → minor clipping risk, but predictions within historical bounds (0.5-2.5 vs past peak 24).
- No dropout/constant issues.

**Comprehensive Features:**
- Median=2.83, mad=1.47 → reference aligns (mean~1.96 close enough, no major bias shift).
- acf1=0.85 → persistent, reference preserves autocorrelation.
- High flatline_ratio suggests low volatility continuation, matching reference fluctuations.
- peak_count=2 → post-peak decay phase.

**Final Strategy:**
- Start with reference_prediction.
- Minor downward shift (-0.05 to peaks) for exogenous negative correlations.
- Preserve all fluctuations/volatility (no smoothing).
- Ensure 96 points, realistic streamflow decay into summer lows (~1-2 cfs).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1979-04-11 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1979-04-12 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Analysis (model_auxiliary_tool):**
- Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (96 values provided).
- It shows gradual decline from ~4.0 to ~1.8 with fluctuations, maintaining realistic volatility matching historical streamflow patterns (peaks/dips).

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
- Top correlations: max/min air temperature (0.39/0.38) → positive relationship.
- No specific future exogenous values provided for prediction window → no quantitative adjustment possible. Maintain base pattern (warmer spring temps likely sustain moderate levels before summer decline).

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool + comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0.0 → no regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=10.69 (past uptrend), slope_second_diff_max=17.58 → past acceleration, but current post-peak (4.30 on 04-11), reference already captures deceleration.
- flatline_ratio=0.82 high → signal has flat periods, but recent dynamic (peaks at 23.95); reference handles with realistic flats/fluctuations → no constant output needed.
- monotone_duration=0.30 → no extreme, no mean reversion forced.
- peak_count=3 → reference maintains ~2-4 range with dips.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):**
- saturation_ratio=0.135 → minor clipping risk; historical max~24, reference max~4.3 → no clipping needed (well below bounds).
- No dropouts → reliable.

**Comprehensive (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=2.90, mad=1.40 → reference starts ~4.0 declining to ~1.8 (reasonable, slight high bias initially → minor downward shift ok).
- acf1=0.84 → persistent; reference preserves autocorrelation via smooth decline.
- flatline_hits=0.135, quality_quantization=0.22 → minor quantization, no major correction.
- event_dominant_pattern=1.0 (rise? but post-peak) → follow reference decline.
- No major corrections needed; reference aligns well.

**Final Strategy:**
- Adopt reference_prediction directly as it captures patterns from similar cases.
- Minor adjustment: slight downward shift (~0.1-0.2) early for median alignment, preserve all fluctuations/volatility.
- Ensure exactly 96 points, realistic streamflow (moderate spring decline into summer lows).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1979-07-16 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1979-07-17 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Analysis:**
- Historical data shows overall downward trend from ~4.2 (Apr 12) to ~0.22 (Jul 16), with peaks around May 26-28 (~4.4) and minor fluctuations.
- Recent values: stable low around 0.19-0.22, indicating baseflow/low summer discharge.
- Median: 0.67, current levels ~0.22 (below median), flatline_ratio=0.9375 high (much time spent flat), run_length_longest=13, sample_entropy low=0.13 (predictable/low variability).

**Tool Integration:**

**model_auxiliary_tool (PRIMARY FOUNDATION):**
- reference_prediction: Starts ~0.42, fluctuates 0.24-0.51 mid, then trends down to ~0.13, late drop to ~0.03-0.2 with small uptick.
- MUST follow this pattern/volatility: initial mild rise/fluctuations, mid stability, late decline to very low summer baseflow.

**exogenous_analysis (KEY REFINEMENT):**
- Strong negative correlations: climatic potential evaporation (-0.73), max air temp (-0.68).
- Mid-summer (Jul-Aug): expect high evaporation/high temps → suppresses discharge (downward pressure).
- No specific future exogenous values provided, but seasonal context (Jul→Sep) implies increasing negative influence → slight downward adjustment to base prediction in later points, emphasizing the late decline.

**changepoint_trend_tool (REGIME/MOMENTUM CORRECTION):**
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=2.25, slope_second_diff_max=2.8 (past peaks/acceleration, but now flat/down).
- flatline_ratio=0.9375 high → lean conservative, low volatility continuation.
- monotone_duration=0.18 low, peak_count=2 → no extreme reversion needed, but expect no new peaks.
- Correction: Reference already captures low/declining; no boost/reversal needed.

**data_quality_tool (QUALITY GATE):**
- saturation_ratio=0.115 moderate → clip extreme highs if any (reference max ~0.51, historical peaks ~4 but recent <0.3 → ok).
- No dropouts/constants → reliable.

**comprehensive_feature_tool:**
- acf1=0.89 high (persistent), flatline high → reference's smooth decline fits.
- No major corrections needed per hints.

**Final Strategy:**
- Use reference_prediction as foundation (closely track values/pattern).
- Minor exogenous adjustment: amplify late decline (~5-10% lower in last 30 points) due to evap/temp.
- Maintain volatility: keep fluctuations (e.g., ~0.24-0.51 early-mid).
- No mono trend: reference has ups/downs → preserve.
- Result: Adjusted reference with slight late suppression for summer drying.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1979-02-22 00:00:00"". Predictions start from ""1979-02-23 00:00:00"" incrementing daily for 96 points.

**Base Foundation (model_auxiliary_tool):**
- Use the 96 reference_prediction values as primary baseline. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Mean ~2.3, shows fluctuations around 2-2.8 with no monotonic trend.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
- Strong negative correlation with climatic potential evaporation (-0.53): higher evaporation lowers streamflow.
- Moderate positive with precipitation (0.22): higher precip increases flow.
- No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor adjustment: slightly dampen the reference (shift down by ~2-5% overall) to account for typical winter-spring evaporation increase, but preserve pattern.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- No changepoints (score=0), so use full history.
- High flatline_ratio (0.84) and flatline_hits (0.05): recent data has long plateaus (e.g., 9-day run), low entropy (0.24). Suggests low volatility regime - reference already matches with stable ~2.0-2.8 range.
- High slope_max (7.95) and slope_second_diff_max (8.01) from past peaks/floods (Jan events), but current downtrend to 0.64. No boost needed; reference shows continuation without extreme reversal.
- Monotone_duration moderate (0.29), no mean reversion forced.
- Peak_count=3, regular spacing: reference has subtle peaks, preserve.

**Quality Check (data_quality_tool):**
- Low issues: saturation 0.05 (minor clipping risk, but reference within historical bounds 0.5-10), no dropouts/constants. No clipping/expansion needed.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- Median=1.46, reference mean ~2.3 (higher due to recent levels ~0.6-2.0 transitioning). Slight downward bias correction: subtract ~0.1-0.2 from reference.
- High acf1 (0.82), low spec_entropy: predictable persistence, reference fits.
- No regime shift/drift.

**Final Strategy:**
- Start with reference_prediction.
- Apply small uniform downward shift (-0.15) for median bias + evaporation correlation.
- Preserve all fluctuations/volatility (no smoothing).
- Ensures 96 points, similar pattern (fluctuating 1.5-2.8 range, gradual decline late).

Computed predictions: reference[i] - 0.15 for each i.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1979-10-20 00:00:00"". Next timestamps start from ""1979-10-21 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They capture patterns from similar historical cases, showing initial rise (0.57 to ~1.05 around step 48), fluctuations, and later decline to ~0.60.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong negative correlations with climatic potential evaporation (-0.458) and max air temp (-0.450). No specific future exogenous values provided, so no direct adjustment possible. Historical low precipitation correlation (0.033) suggests limited rain-driven spikes expected.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- No changepoints (score=0), so no memory truncation.
- High flatline_ratio (0.8125), long run_length (15), but recent uptrend with slope_max=0.7334 and slope_second_diff_max=1.1906 → supports momentum continuation initially, aligning with reference rise.
- Recent history shows recession from Oct peak (0.6632 → 0.3496), but reference predicts renewed rise, consistent with past cycles (e.g., Sep/Oct peaks).
- No need for reversal/mean reversion (monotone_duration low).

**Data Quality:** Minor saturation (0.094), quantization (0.333) → clip if needed, but reference within historical bounds (min~0.135, max~1.35). No dropout.

**Comprehensive Features:** High ACF1 (0.78) indicates persistence (supports reference continuation). Median=0.225, but recent higher → reference appropriately elevated. Low changepoint_score, moderate spec_entropy → reference reliable.

**Final Strategy:** Use reference_prediction directly as it matches data dynamics (persistence, cycles, recent up-momentum). No major corrections needed; maintains volatility/fluctuations (peaks ~1.05, troughs ~0.60). Minor smoothing not required as pattern fits MOPEX streamflow behavior post-peak.

<tool_think>
All tools considered: base as foundation, exogenous no adjustment (no future data), trend supports rise continuation, quality ok.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1980-03-12 00:00:00"". Next timestamps start from ""1980-03-13 00:00:00"" incrementing daily by 1 day for 96 points.

**Base Prediction**: Use model_auxiliary_tool's reference_prediction (96 values) as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Prediction shows mild fluctuations around ~0.8-1.2 initially, gradually declining to ~0.7-0.8, with no monotonic trend.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlations with daily min temp (0.58) and max temp (0.43). No actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Qualitatively, since recent flow is declining post-peak, assume cooling spring temps support gradual decline matching reference.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool)**:
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- flatline_ratio=0.61 high: Signal has long flat periods, but recent data post-peak is declining with dynamics.
- slope_max=1.73, slope_second_diff_max=1.93: Recent uptrend acceleration (from late Feb low to Mar 8 peak), now decelerating post-peak → supports reference's mild continuation then stabilization.
- No mean reversion needed (monotone_duration=0.24 low), no dead signal override.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool)**:
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.23 moderate: Some clipping risk, but values within historical bounds (min~0.26, max~3.64). No clipping needed.
- No dropouts, good quality.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- High flatline_ratio and low sample_entropy=0.11 confirm low predictability/noise, but acf1=0.86 shows persistence → reference already smooth.
- Median=0.59, reference mean ~0.95 (higher due to recent peak influence), no strong bias correction.
- No major corrections needed per _llm_hints.

**Final Decision**: Reference_prediction is optimal base. No significant adjustments warranted (no changepoint, no exogenous data, quality ok). Minor smoothing for flatline_ratio by averaging neighbors slightly, but preserve fluctuations/volatility. Prediction follows reference closely: initial mild rise then decline to stable low flow.
<tool_think>
All tools used: reference as base, exogenous qualitative (no data), changepoint (no shift), quality (no clip), comprehensive (low entropy → conservative).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1980-04-29 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1980-04-30 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Analysis:**
- reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Primary foundation with 96 values, showing gradual decline from ~2.2 to ~1.2 with fluctuations (e.g., peaks around 2.3, dips to 1.2). Must closely follow this pattern/volatility.

**Tool Insights for Refinement:**

<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis:**
- Strongest correlations: daily min temp (0.62), climatic evap (0.53). Both positive, suggesting higher values in warmer/drier conditions. No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor upward bias possible but reference already incorporates similar cases.

**comprehensive_feature_tool / changepoint_trend_tool:**
- High flatline_ratio (0.72), flatline_hits (0.375), run_length_longest (36): Indicates periods of stability, but recent data post-flood shows clear decline from peaks (11+ to 1.8).
- slope_max (4.64), slope_second_diff_max (6.37): Recent momentum from flood recession.
- peak_count (2), no changepoints (score 0): Continue post-peak decline pattern.
- sample_entropy low (0.11): Predictable signal.
- No regime shift; extrapolate recent declining trend with fluctuations.

**data_quality_tool:**
- quality_saturation_ratio (0.375): Moderate clipping risk; clip if needed but reference stays within historical bounds (0.25-11).
- No dropouts/constants.

**Summary Corrections:**
- Use reference as base (captures pattern).
- Minor boost early (exogenous warming in spring), then follow decline.
- Maintain volatility: small fluctuations as in reference.
- No major deviation: declining trend with ~1.5-2.2 range.
</tool_think>

**Final Strategy:**
- Base: reference_prediction directly.
- Adjustments: Slight upward shift (+0.05 avg) for exogenous/temp correlation and recent level (last=1.82 > ref start 2.21? Wait, ref starts higher but historical declining; actually ref calibrated to similar cases).
- Actually, last historical 1.8158, ref[0]=2.21 seems continuation; no big shift needed.
- Apply tiny exogenous boost (scale by 1.02 for top correlations), but keep close to reference pattern.
- Ensure 96 floats, timestamps correct.
- Prediction: reference with minimal smoothing for natural flow.

Your current task is to predict daily streamflow discharge (MOPEX dataset).

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 1 day.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 1 day
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #2)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
[Format Validation Failed] Format validation failed: failed to extract <answer></answer> tag content from response
[LLM Evaluation] <think>
The provided response fails format validation because it lacks <answer></answer> tags with valid JSON containing exactly 96 time points. It also appears incomplete (cut off mid-sentence) and does not deliver the required JSON output with timestamps starting from ""1979-12-08 00:00:00"" incrementing daily, using the reference predictions refined by tool insights (e.g., dampen peaks slightly for exogenous factors).
</think>

<answer>
{{""status"": ""failed"", ""suggestions"": ""Complete the response by adding <answer></answer> tags with valid JSON array of exactly 96 objects, each with 'timestamp' (e.g., '1979-12-08 00:00:00') and 'prediction' keys using refined reference values; ensure timestamps match input format and predictions reflect tool adjustments.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""1979-12-07 00:00:00"". Next timestamps start from ""1979-12-08 00:00:00"" and increment daily by 1 day for 96 points.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool provides exactly 96 reference values, which must serve as the primary foundation. These capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases.

Tool analysis:
<tool_think>
- exogenous_analysis: Negative correlations with evaporation (-0.555) and max temp (-0.396) suggest mild dampening due to likely winter conditions reducing evaporation, but no specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment: dampen peaks by ~2-5% in reference_prediction.
- comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool: High flatline_ratio (0.906), low changepoint_score (0), 3 peaks, high acf1 (0.86) indicate persistent but punctuated flow with long stable periods post-flood peaks. Recent data shows post-flood decay (from 6.76 peak to 1.49). No regime shift, so continue gradual decay with fluctuations. slope_max (3.41) suggests momentum continuation but flatline implies stabilization around 1.5-2.0. No truncation needed.
- data_quality_tool: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.094), no clipping or uncertainty expansion required.
- Overall: Refine reference by slight dampening (multiply by 0.97 factor on values >2.0 to account for evap correlation and mean reversion post-flood), preserve all fluctuations/volatility.
</tool_think>

Final prediction uses reference_prediction with minor exogenous dampening on peaks for refinement, ensuring exactly 96 fluctuating points around ~1.8-2.0 mean, matching historical stabilization.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1980-08-03 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1980-08-04 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (96 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases. Mean of reference ~0.74, aligns with recent historical values (~0.87 on last day) and median (0.54).

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong negative correlations with max air temp (-0.27) and potential evaporation (-0.23). No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor conservative downward adjustment (~2-5% on higher peaks) to reflect drying summer conditions, but preserve pattern/volatility.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis**:
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift, use full history.
- flatline_ratio high (0.79): Signal has long stable periods, but reference_prediction already incorporates fluctuations appropriately (not constant).
- slope_max=2.95, slope_second_diff_max=4.09: Recent momentum captured in reference.
- peak_count=2, sample_entropy low (0.36): Predictable low-entropy signal, follow reference fluctuations.
- No need for truncation/boost/reversion; reference handles dynamics.

**Data Quality**: quality_quantization_score=0.33 (moderate), saturation_ratio=0.125 (low), no dropouts/constants. No clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- High flatline_ratio but low changepoint_score: Reference prediction shows realistic oscillation around ~0.5-1.0, matching historical summer baseflow decline.
- acf1=0.65: Persistent autocorrelation, reference preserves.
- No major bias (residual_mean~0), qkurt high (fat tails): Keep reference volatility.

**Final Strategy**: Base prediction is strong foundation. Minor exogenous-driven damping on peaks (subtract ~0.02-0.05 where >1.0, tapering to 0). Maintain exact 96-point fluctuation pattern/volatility. No mono-trend imposition.

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Primary base, no override.
- exogenous_analysis: Minor downward tweak for negative temp/evap corr.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Confirms level/scale (median 0.54), high flatline (preserve stability), momentum ok.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No regime/momentum corrections triggered.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data, no gates.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1980-06-16 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1980-06-17 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY foundation (96 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Strong negative correlations with climatic potential evaporation (-0.72) and max air temp (-0.59). However, no actual exogenous values provided for prediction window, so cannot apply specific adjustments. Note for context: expect downward pressure in high evap/temp conditions, but base prediction likely already incorporates via similar cases.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 1.09785 (baseline level), MAD 0.723 (moderate volatility), high flatline_ratio implied (0.875), low changepoint (0.0), low sample_entropy (0.085 - predictable), long run_length (32). Signal is mostly stable/decaying post-flood with flats. Reference_prediction shows appropriate low-volatility fluctuations around ~0.5-0.8, matching median/MAD.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0), high flatline_ratio (0.875), moderate slope_max (4.64 - past peak), low monotone_duration (0.125). No regime shift or momentum boost needed; continue gradual decay/stability. No early reversal or mean reversion triggered. High flatline supports conservative, low-volatility forecast matching reference.

**data_quality_tool**: Moderate quantization (0.43), low saturation (0.15) - minor clipping risk, but no major quality issues. No uncertainty expansion or invalidation needed.

Overall: No major corrections required. Base prediction aligns with diagnostics (low entropy, flatlines → stable forecast).
</tool_think>

**Final Strategy**: Adopt reference_prediction directly as it matches data characteristics (post-flood recession, low volatility). Minor smoothing not needed due to no quality/regime issues. Maintains required fluctuation pattern.
</think>

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1979-09-02 00:00:00"". Next timestamps start from ""1979-09-03 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Analysis (model_auxiliary_tool):**
- Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation (96 values provided).
- It shows fluctuations around 0.4-0.9 initially, gradually trending downward to ~0.35, with volatility matching expected streamflow patterns from similar cases.
- MUST preserve this pattern, volatility, and fluctuations - no smoothing or monotonic changes.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
- Negative correlations: daily min temp (-0.273), max temp (-0.207) → higher temps linked to lower discharge.
- No actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window → cannot apply quantitative adjustments. Use qualitatively: expect gradual decline if assuming typical fall temp rise, but defer to reference_prediction which likely incorporates this.

**Trend & Regime (changepoint_trend_tool + comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- High flatline_ratio (0.82): indicates long stable periods, but run_length_longest=23, sample_entropy low (0.11) → low predictability, conservative approach.
- No changepoints (score=0), slope_max=0.34 (past uptrend), but monotone_duration low (0.125) → no strong regime shift or reversion needed.
- flatline_hits=0.125 → not ""dead signal"", so follow reference_prediction fluctuations rather than constant.
- No truncation/boost/reversal corrections applied.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):**
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.125 (low), quantization=0.48 → minor clipping risk, but no strong bounds needed (historical min~0.14, max~2.1).
- No dropout → no uncertainty expansion.

**Overall Strategy:**
- Foundation: reference_prediction (closely follow all 96 values).
- Adjustments: None significant - no exogenous data, no regime shifts, low corrections needed.
- Final: Use reference_prediction directly as it captures patterns from similar cases, volatility, and expected decline aligning with negative temp correlations and historical baseflow decay into fall.

Your current task is to predict daily streamflow discharge (MOPEX dataset).

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 1 day.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 1 day
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #2)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The current validation failed due to incorrect number of prediction points (100 instead of 96). The response identifies correct timestamps starting ""1980-01-25 00:00:00"" daily, plans to use a 96-value base prediction from reference, and outlines reasonable adjustments based on exogenous correlations and tools. To pass, truncate/reformat the JSON in <answer> to exactly 96 time points matching input timestamp format (e.g., ""1980-01-25 00:00:00"" to ""1980-04-29 00:00:00""), ensuring valid JSON with keys as timestamps and values following the described ~1.5-2.0 declining oscillatory pattern.
</think>

<answer>
{{""PASS"": false, ""modification"": ""Truncate prediction JSON to exactly 96 points starting from '1980-01-25 00:00:00' daily; ensure valid JSON structure with timestamp keys matching input format and values closely following base reference pattern.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""1980-01-24 00:00:00"". Predictions start from ""1980-01-25 00:00:00"" and increment daily for exactly 96 points, ending at ""1980-04-29 00:00:00"".

Base from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96-value reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation. It shows fluctuating pattern around ~1.5-2.0 with oscillations, peaks ~2.2-2.3, dips ~1.5, matching streamflow dynamics post-flood recession.

Tool analysis for refinements:
<tool_think>
- exogenous_analysis: Weak positive corr with min temp (0.17), negative with evap (-0.13). No specific future values provided, so minor adjustment: slight upward bias early (temp influence), dampen peaks (evap). Keep close to base.
- comprehensive_feature_tool / basic_statistics_tool: Median 0.885 << base mean ~1.7 → BIAS CORRECTION needed: shift base down slightly (~10-15%) to align level. High acf1 (0.82) confirms persistence; spec_entropy moderate → follow base fluctuations conservatively. High qkurt (5.1) → maintain peaked shape.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints (score 0), high flatline_ratio (0.77) but recent dynamic (peaks), slope_max 3.41 → BOOST momentum slightly in uptrends within base. Low monotone_duration → no reversion needed.
Overall: Start with reference_prediction, apply ~12% downward shift for median bias (new mean ~1.5-1.7), preserve exact fluctuation pattern/volatility (no smoothing), minor exogenous tilt (first 20 pts +0.02, later -0.01).
</tool_think>

Final pattern: Declining oscillatory ~1.5-2.0, adjusted values computed as ref * 0.88 + small noise preserving relative changes. Ensures exactly 96 valid floats, JSON keys match format.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1980-09-20 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1980-09-21 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 96 values). It captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Prediction shows fluctuations around 0.6-0.7 with no monotonic trend.

**Exogenous Refinement** (exogenous_analysis): 
- Top correlation: climatic potential evaporation (0.45, positive) → higher evap → higher streamflow.
- Daily max air temp (-0.22, negative) → higher temp → lower streamflow.
- No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor adjustment not applied. Correlation strengths are moderate, so stick close to base.

**Changepoint & Trend** (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0 → No regime shift, use full history.
- flatline_ratio=0.72 (high) → Mostly flat/low entropy signal (sample_entropy=0.2), but reference_prediction already accounts for this with mild fluctuations.
- slope_max=2.95, slope_second_diff_max=4.09 → Past peaks exist, but no current strong momentum to boost/reverse.
- No truncation, boosting, or reversion needed. Reference handles dynamics.

**Data Quality** (data_quality_tool): 
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.10 (minor), quality_dropout=0 → No clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Features** (comprehensive_feature_tool):
- median=0.33, mad=0.10 → Low baseline/volatility; reference mean ~0.66 is higher due to recent levels (~0.23), appropriate for continuation.
- acf1=0.67 → Persistent, but reference preserves this.
- flatline_ratio high, peak_count=3 → Reference maintains realistic low-volatility fluctuations.
- No major corrections (e.g., no bias shift as median reflects full history).

**Final Decision**: Reference_prediction is optimal foundation. No significant deviations needed. Use it directly to match patterns/volatility. Minor smoothing not required as it already fits low-entropy signal.

**Tool Think Summary**:
- Foundation: reference_prediction (primary).
- Adjustments: None major (low changepoint, moderate exog corrs, good quality).
- Preserve: Fluctuations, volatility ~0.05-0.1 std dev.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1980-12-25 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1980-12-26 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 96 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar cases.

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Strong negative correlations with climatic potential evaporation (-0.686) and max air temp (-0.51). No exogenous time series data provided for prediction window, so cannot apply quantitative adjustments. Slight downward bias possible if evaporation/temp high, but conservatively minimal adjustment to base.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 0.533 (reference starts ~0.85, higher but recent data ~0.6-0.7), high flatline_ratio (0.73) indicates much stable periods, low changepoint_score (0), high slope_max (1.73) shows past peaks, low sample_entropy (0.145) suggests predictability. No major bias correction needed; reference likely accounts for this.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No regime shift (changepoint=0), high flatline but recent declining from peaks, momentum slowing (post-peak). No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference follows post-peak decay pattern.

**data_quality_tool**: Minor saturation (0.17), no dropout/constants. No clipping/amplification required.
</tool_think>

**Final Decision**: Reference_prediction is strong foundation with appropriate post-peak decline and fluctuations matching historical volatility (peaks ~2.4, decay to ~0.6). Minor exogenous negative correlation suggests slight downward tilt, but preserve pattern/volatility. No significant deviations: use reference directly (small rounding for floats).

Timestamps generated correctly (Dec 26 to Mar 31, 1981).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1981-02-11 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1981-02-12 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Foundation (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the 96 reference_prediction values as primary baseline. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Mean ~1.45, shows fluctuations with overall mild upward trend then stabilization/variations - must preserve this.

**Key Insights from Tools:**

**<tool_think>**
- **exogenous_analysis**: Moderate positive correlations with temperatures (max 0.28, min 0.24). No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor upward bias possible but no strong adjustment needed.
- **event_summary_tool**: dominant_pattern_name=""rise"" (event_counts [4 rise, 3 fall, 1 flat]). Constraint: Maintain upward trend - reference already shows this mildly, so reinforce slightly if needed.
- **changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0). High flatline_ratio=0.656 but recent data ending at 1.6097 shows momentum (slope_max=1.73). 3 peaks detected. Preserve reference fluctuations; no truncation/boost needed. run_length_longest=21 indicates past plateaus, but current up.
- **ar_residual_tool**: residual_mean≈0 (no bias correction). residual_acf1=0.24 moderate (some nonlinear pattern), residual_max=1.70 suggests tail risk - keep reference volatility.
- **data_quality_tool**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.02 minor clipping risk, quantization=0.18). No major uncertainty expansion/clipping.
- **comprehensive_feature_tool**: median=0.62 (reference higher ~1.45, consistent with recent rise from low base). High flatline_ratio but low changepoint. acf1=0.86 strong persistence. spec_entropy=1.18 moderate noise. event_dominant=0 (rise). No major corrections.
</tool_think>

**Final Reasoning:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation. Minor refinements:
- Slight upward shift (~+0.02 avg) early to align with temperature corr + rise dominance + recent value 1.6097.
- Preserve all fluctuations/volatility (no smoothing).
- No regime shift/quality issues. End with stabilization per reference pattern.
- Computed predictions: reference + small rise bias decaying to 0, ensuring exactly 96 floats.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""1981-03-31 00:00:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""1981-04-01 00:00:00"" incrementing daily.

**Base Analysis (model_auxiliary_tool):**
- Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (96 values provided).
- It shows initial elevated levels (~2.1-2.4), gradual decline with fluctuations to ~1.0, then further to ~0.3-0.4, ending low (~0.28).
- Maintain its volatility, fluctuations, and overall declining pattern. No major deviations.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
- Strongest correlations: daily min temp (0.58), max temp (0.46).
- No actual exogenous time series values provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment only: slightly smooth declines assuming spring warming supports gradual baseflow decay post-flood.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift; use full history).
- High flatline_ratio=0.71, flatline_hits=0.25 (much flat periods pre-flood, but recent dynamic).
- slope_max=4.51 (past flood rise), but current post-peak decline.
- peak_count=1, low sample_entropy=0.11 (predictable decay).
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; follow reference decline.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):**
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.25 (moderate; no hard clipping).
- quality_quantization_score=0.44 (fair; low uncertainty amplification).
- Reliable for forecasting.

**Comprehensive (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=0.91 (reference starts higher but declines toward/around it).
- mad=0.47 (moderate volatility; matches reference fluctuations).
- acf1=0.95 (persistent; reference captures).
- No major corrections needed.

**Final Strategy:**
- Foundation: reference_prediction directly.
- Minor refinements: Smooth extreme fluctuations slightly (<5% tweak) for temp correlations/quality; ensure gradual decay to low baseflow.
- Preserve pattern: elevated early, fluctuating decline, low end.
- No exogenous series → no strong adjustments.
- Output exactly 96 points.

<tool_think>
All tools used: base as foundation, exogenous for correlation awareness (no series → light touch), changepoint/quality/comprehensive confirm no major corrections (low changepoint, fair quality, predictable decay).

Your current task is to predict daily streamflow discharge (MOPEX dataset).

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 1 day.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 1 day
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #3)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response shows good reasoning on timestamp generation (96 daily points from 1980-11-08 to 1981-02-11, correct), use of reference predictions, exogenous dampening, and changepoint stability. However, format validation failed previously due to incorrect number of points (got 2 instead of 96), and this review response lacks the required <answer> JSON with exactly 96 predictions—must include valid JSON in final output to pass. Suggestion: Generate full 96-value JSON using refined reference (minor peak dampening 2-5% on >0.7 values, slight late downward bias, preserve low-flow plateaus).
</think>

<answer>
{{""PASS"": false, ""modification"": ""Include valid JSON in <answer> with exactly 96 timestamp-value pairs (timestamps: '1980-11-08 00:00:00' to '1981-02-11 00:00:00', daily increments); apply 2-5% dampening to reference peaks >0.7 and slight downward trend in later half.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""1980-11-07 00:00:00"". Prediction timestamps start from next day: ""1980-11-08 00:00:00"" to ""1981-02-11 00:00:00"" (exactly 96 daily increments, verified: Nov 24 days + Dec 31 + Jan 31 + Feb 11 = 97 days from 11-08 to 02-11 inclusive).

**Base from model_auxiliary_tool**: Use reference_prediction (96 values) as PRIMARY foundation. It shows initial peak around 0.7-0.8 (indices 7-20), mid-period plateau ~0.6-0.7, gradual decline to ~0.2 by end. Maintain its fluctuations, volatility, and patterns.

**Refinements from feedback & tools**:
- **Previous feedback**: Apply 2-5% dampening to peaks >0.7; slight late downward bias; preserve low-flow plateaus. Identified peaks in reference: indices ~7-20,24-26 (0.74-0.83). Dampen these by 3% avg (e.g., 0.834→0.809, 0.762→0.739).
- **exogenous_analysis**: Negative correlations (max temp -0.197, evap -0.081) suggest cooling/drying suppresses flow. Apply mild downward adjustment (-2-5% scaling, stronger late period for downward bias).
- **changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0), high flatline_ratio (0.54) but recent history post-peak (Oct 26 spike) shows decay—preserve reference decline but stabilize plateaus. slope_max high indicates momentum captured in reference.
- **comprehensive_feature_tool**: High flatline_ratio & qkurt suggest intermittent stability—smooth minor noise but keep reference fluctuations. Median 0.222, reference late values align (~0.2).
- **data_quality_tool**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation low)—no clipping needed, but bound predictions to hist range [0.135,1.114].

**Final adjustment strategy**:
1. Start with reference_prediction.
2. Dampen peaks >0.7 by 3% (avg feedback).
3. Apply slight downward trend: multiply late half (48-96) by 0.97 for bias.
4. Smooth minor jumps (<0.02) for stability, preserve volatility (std ref ~0.13).
5. Ensure exactly 96 floats, matching patterns.

Verification: Output JSON has 96 keys, timestamps correct, values float (2-4 decimals).
