## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-17 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-11-18 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (96 values provided). This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Final prediction must closely follow its pattern/fluctuations.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.72) and direct_radiation (0.45). No actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so minor refinement only. Reference already likely incorporates these via similar cases.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- High flatline_ratio (0.79), flatline_hits (0.094), low sample_entropy (0.165) → recent data very flat at ~-0.3, low signal complexity.
- High acf1 (0.97) → strong persistence.
- slope_max=11, slope_second_diff_max=12.3 → past momentum, but current flat.
- event_dominant_pattern=0 (""rise"") but recent history contradicts (long flat).

**Changepoint/Trend**:
- changepoint_score=0 → no regime shift.
- flatline_ratio high → consider conservative constant output, but reference shows fluctuations, so follow reference.
- monotone_duration low, peak_count=2 → past peaks, reference anticipates recovery.

**Data Quality**: Minor saturation (0.094), no dropouts → clip if needed, but reference values low (range ~-0.2 to ~4.8), within historical bounds (min -1.8, max 50+).

**Event Summary**: dominant_pattern_name=""rise"" → maintain upward trend constraint. Reference shows overall upward trajectory with fluctuations (starts ~1.5-4, peaks ~4.2), aligns well.

**Corrections Applied**:
- BIAS: Historical median=7.59, reference mean ~2.5 → slight upward shift (+~1.0 average) for level correction, but keep volatility/pattern.
- FLATLINE/PERSISTENCE: Recent flat ~-0.3, but high flatline_ratio suggests caution; however, dominant ""rise"" + exogenous wind correlation → follow reference upward recovery.
- VOLATILITY: Preserve reference fluctuations (not monotonic).
- No major truncation/boost needed (low changepoint, past momentum).
- Final: reference * 1.1 (slight rise bias) + small noise for wind-like variability, rounded to 2 decimals.

Adjusted prediction closely tracks reference with minor upward bias for ""rise"" constraint and historical median.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-14 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start at ""2024-11-15 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They show a gradual decline from ~20.8 to ~15-16 range, with fluctuations, maintaining volatility consistent with historical wind power patterns (evening peak decaying overnight).

Exogenous analysis:
- Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.7865): Recent historical uptrend to 26.54 aligns with increasing wind; reference_prediction's mild decline suggests stabilizing winds ahead.
- Strong negative correlation with wind_direction_80m (-0.795): Direction shifts likely moderating output.
- No exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment: slightly smooth the decline to account for wind persistence, but stay close to reference.

Changepoint_trend_tool:
- No changepoints (score=0), so no memory truncation.
- High slope_max (7.7) and slope_second_diff_max (6.3) indicate recent strong uptrend momentum; reference already captures post-peak decay, no boost needed.
- High flatline_ratio (0.61) historically, but recent peak active; maintain fluctuations.
- Low sample_entropy (0.087): predictable signal, trust reference.

Data_quality_tool:
- Low saturation (0.083), no clipping needed.
- No dropouts/constants, data reliable.

Comprehensive_feature_tool:
- Median=0, but recent regime shifted to positive; reference correctly elevated.
- High acf1 (0.92): strong autocorrelation, reference preserves.
- High flatline historically, but prediction shows volatility - good.
- No major corrections needed per hints.

Final strategy: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches wind power characteristics (post-peak decay with noise). Minor smoothing for exogenous wind persistence (average adjacent points slightly), but preserve exact 96 points and volatility. No regime shift or quality issues override.
<tool_think>
All tools considered: base as foundation, exogenous supports mild decline, trend tools confirm no major corrections, quality clean.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-15 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-11-16 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases.

Exogenous analysis: Strongest correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.56) and wind_direction_80m (0.34). No specific future exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct numerical adjustments possible. Slight positive adjustment possible if assuming continued favorable winds, but keep minor since no data.

Comprehensive features: Median 39.44 (reference mean ~34.5, slightly low -> minor upward bias correction possible). High flatline_ratio (0.97) but historical shows clear diurnal peaks, so not dead signal. High acf1 (0.89) indicates persistence, which reference likely captures. spec_entropy 1.09 suggests some noise -> conservative adjustments. No changepoints.

Changepoint_trend: No changepoints (score 0). High slope_max (36.2) and slope_second_diff_max (36.8) indicate strong past momentum, but recent data ending at 33.44 shows decline from evening peak -> reference already accounts for cycle.

Data quality: Low issues (saturation 0.02, no dropouts/constants), no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

Overall: Reference prediction shows gradual decline from ~35 to ~27, with small fluctuations - matches wind power night-time behavior post-peak. Minor upward shift (~+2-3) for median bias and wind correlation, preserving exact pattern/volatility. No major deviations.

Final prediction: reference + small bias correction (avg shift ~2.5 to align median), rounded to 2 decimals.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-11-20 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-11-21 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes each.

**Base Prediction**: Use the reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as the PRIMARY foundation (exactly 96 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar historical cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**:
- Top correlations: wind_speed_80m (0.85), wind_direction_80m (0.83). No actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Slight positive bias possible due to correlations, but base already incorporates patterns.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis**:
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=23.3 (high recent uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=28.6 (strong acceleration earlier).
- flatline_ratio=0.92 (high, but recent data shows volatility; not ""dead signal"").
- peak_count=1, recent uptrend to 101.34 suggests continuation then stabilization.
- No truncation/boost needed; base prediction shows gradual decline from ~82 to ~71 with fluctuations, aligning with post-peak stabilization in wind power.

**Data Quality**:
- saturation_ratio=0.10 (minor clipping risk), quantization=0.16 (low). No major clipping/uncertainty expansion needed. Historical max ~118, base max 82 (safe).

**Comprehensive Features**:
- Median=27.9 (base mean ~73 higher, but recent values 50-100 justify).
- acf1=0.97 (strong persistence), spec_entropy=1.41 (moderate noise).
- flatline high but recent dynamic. Base prediction maintains realistic volatility/fluctuations.

**Final Decision**: Base prediction is reliable foundation. No major corrections (no changepoints, no exogenous series, quality ok). Minor refinement: slight upward bias in first 12 points due to recent momentum (slope_max high) and correlations, then follow base decline/stabilization pattern. Maintain exact volatility/fluctuations (no smoothing). Values rounded to 2 decimals matching input style.

<tool_think>
- Used model_auxiliary_tool: direct foundation.
- exogenous_analysis: noted correlations but no adjustment data.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: confirmed persistence/volatility.
- changepoint_trend_tool: no regime shift, momentum supports base.
- data_quality_tool: minor saturation, no clipping.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-19 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-11-20 00:00:00"" through approximately ""2024-11-22 23:45:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They show an initial slight rise, stabilization around 23-25, gradual decline to ~10, with minor fluctuations – this captures the expected wind power pattern (low nighttime/early morning continuation from historical decline).

Exogenous analysis:
- Strongest correlation: wind_speed_80m (0.576), direct_radiation (0.373).
- No specific future exogenous values provided in tool output, so cannot make quantitative adjustments. Qualitatively, low power levels suggest low wind speeds expected; no strong reason to deviate from base.

Changepoint_trend_tool:
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift; use full history.
- slope_max=21.4, slope_second_diff_max=17.9: Past momentum (morning rise), but current is late-night decline; base prediction already incorporates deceleration/decline.
- flatline_ratio=0.92 high: Signal has long flat periods, but recent is declining (not fully flat); base shows appropriate low-variability decline – no need for constant output.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; base aligns.

Comprehensive_feature_tool & data_quality_tool:
- Median=57.5, but recent values ~10-15 (nighttime low); base correctly shifted low.
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.031 low, no clipping needed.
- flatline_ratio high but quality_dropout=0, quantization=0.19 acceptable; no major uncertainty amplification.
- acf1=0.93 high (persistent), spec_entropy=0.62 moderate; base preserves autocorrelation in smooth decline.

Overall: Base prediction is optimal foundation. No strong corrections indicated (no changepoints, low quality issues, no exogenous data for adjustment). Minor smoothing if needed, but preserve fluctuations (e.g., small rises/dips in base). Final prediction uses reference values directly (rounded to 2 decimals for consistency with input style, but as floats).

<tool_think>
- Used model_auxiliary_tool as primary (reference_prediction).
- Incorporated exogenous_analysis correlations qualitatively (low power aligns with expected low wind).
- Applied changepoint_trend_tool: no regime shift, high flatline but declining trend followed.
- Data quality good, no clipping/amplification.
- Comprehensive hints: median for baseline (recent low), momentum for decline continuation.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #2)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
[Format Validation Failed] Format validation failed: incorrect number of prediction points (expected 96, got 97)
[LLM Evaluation] <think>
The provided response fails format validation due to incorrect number of prediction points (97 instead of required 96). Additionally, the <answer> section is missing entirely (no JSON with 96 time points present). To fix, truncate or adjust to exactly 96 timestamps starting from ""2024-11-12 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes, complete the thinking process briefly, and add a valid JSON in <answer> tags with keys like ""timestamp"" array and ""prediction"" array of 96 values based on the reference_prediction mean ~26.3.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-11-11 23:45:00"". Next timestamps start at ""2024-11-12 00:00:00"" and increment by 15 minutes for exactly 96 points (4 full days).

The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool has exactly 96 values (mean ~26.3), which is the PRIMARY foundation. It shows fluctuations around ~20-29 with no monotonic trend, matching wind power volatility.

Key refinements:
- <tool_think>exogenous_analysis</tool_think>: Strong positive corr with wind_speed_80m (0.85), negative with wind_direction_80m (-0.84). No exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment not needed; stick close to reference.
- <tool_think>event_summary_tool</tool_think>: dominant_pattern_name ""rise"" (event_counts [4,4,0,0]), but reference already maintains mild upward fluctuations initially then stabilizes—aligns.
- <tool_think>changepoint_trend_tool</tool_think>: No changepoints (score 0), high flatline_ratio (0.95) indicates low volatility periods, but reference has appropriate small fluctuations; no truncation/boost needed. slope_max positive but low impact.
- <tool_think>data_quality_tool</tool_think>: Minor saturation (0.11), no clipping required.
- <tool_think>comprehensive_feature_tool</tool_think>: High acf1 (0.97) indicates persistence, median 55.79 higher than ref mean ~26 but recent history low/negative, so reference (trained on similar cases) is appropriate; no major bias shift.
- <tool_think>cross_channel_tool</tool_think>: corr_flip_count 4, reduce cross-weight; no strong lead-lag adjustment.

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction directly as it captures patterns/volatility from similar cases. Previous attempt had 97 points and wrong format; ensure exactly 96 key-value pairs in object format.

Generate timestamps:
- Start: 2024-11-12 00:00:00
- End: 2024-11-14 23:45:00 (96 steps of 15min)

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
The historical data shows a long flatline at 0.0 until late evening, then a sharp ramp-up starting around 19:00 with a peak near 22:30-22:45 (61.34), followed by a decline to 36.44 at 23:45. This indicates wind onset in the evening.

**Base prediction analysis (model_auxiliary_tool):**
- The reference_prediction provides 96 values starting from ~26.82, showing realistic wind power behavior: gradual decline initially (post-peak decay), stabilization around 21-27, minor dips and rises, a secondary rise around index 55-60 (~22-23), and late stabilization/fluctuations.
- Mean ~23.5, std ~1.7, maintains volatility consistent with historical ramp-up/peak/decay patterns from similar cases.
- This is the PRIMARY foundation; final prediction must closely follow its pattern, volatility, and fluctuations.

**Exogenous refinement (exogenous_analysis):**
- Strong negative correlation with temperature_2m (-0.55): cooler temps favor higher wind power.
- Positive correlation with wind_direction_80m (0.38) and wind_speed_80m (0.30).
- No specific future exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment: slightly boost if assuming continued favorable wind conditions post-onset, but keep close to base (e.g., +0.5 avg shift). However, prioritize base pattern.

**Changepoint & trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0 (no structural breaks), monotone_duration=0.79 (recent uptrend), slope_max=15.9 (strong ramp captured), slope_second_diff_max=11 (acceleration then likely deceleration).
- peak_count=1, flatline_ratio=0.1875 (initial calm, now active).
- Hints: momentum from uptrend suggests continued elevated levels but with deceleration (predict gradual decline/reversal as in base). No truncation needed. sample_entropy low → predictable continuation.
- No mean reversion (not extreme monotone), no dead signal.

**Data quality (data_quality_tool):**
- Good quality: quantization=0.875, saturation=0.03125 (minor clipping at peak, so clip predictions if exceeding hist max 61.34, but base max ~27 well below), no dropouts/constants.
- No uncertainty expansion or clipping needed.

**Comprehensive hints (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=0, mad=0 (historical baseline low, but recent active), acf1=0.95 (persistent), spec_entropy=3.24 (some noise → conservative smoothing not needed as base has fluctuations).
- cusum_max=435 (detected ramp), event_segment_count=7 (matches ramp/peak).
- No major bias correction (recent mean ~30 aligns with base start ~26).

**Final strategy:**
- Use reference_prediction as foundation (closely follow values/pattern).
- Minor boost (+0.2 to +1.0) early for continued post-peak momentum (slope_max high), then follow decline/stabilization.
- Maintain all fluctuations (no smoothing).
- Ensure 96 points, timestamps from 2024-11-26 00:00:00 incrementing 15min.
- Result: slight upward adjustment to base for refinement, preserving volatility.

**Tool integration summary (<tool_think>):**
- Base: follow reference_prediction pattern/volatility strictly.
- Exog: minor boost for wind persistence.
- Changepoint/trend: continue deceleration post-peak.
- Quality: reliable, no clipping.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #2)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
[Format Validation Failed] Format validation failed: incorrect number of prediction points (expected 96, got 93)
[LLM Evaluation] <think>
Format validation failed due to incorrect number of prediction points (93 instead of 96). To fix, extend the prediction by adding 3 more timestamps/values starting from the next 15-minute interval after the current last point, ensuring exactly 96 points with consistent timestamp format (e.g., ""2024-11-23 23:45:00"" style). Use the base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool (already 96 values) as foundation, appending/adjusting recent values based on median 46.19 and high flatline_ratio for stability.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-11-23 23:45:00"". Next prediction starts at ""2024-11-24 00:00:00"", incrementing by 15 minutes for exactly 96 points (spans 24 hours to ""2024-11-24 23:45:00"").

Previous attempt failed with only 93 points; the provided list ends prematurely at ""2024-11-25 00:30:00"". I will generate exactly 96 points.

Base from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values directly as foundation (they capture similar case patterns).

Key diagnostics from tools:
- comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool: flatline_ratio=0.71875 (high, ~72% flat periods, esp. recent 0.0), median=46.19. Recent history ends at prolonged 0.0 flatline (from 16:45 onward). High flatline suggests dead/low signal regime; however, reference_prediction shows realistic low-level fluctuations (mean ~9-10, range ~5-13), not constant 0. Do not override to constant (would ignore base).
- No changepoints (score=0), but high flatline_hits=0.302, run_length_longest=8.0 (night flat). Predict continuation of low generation post-night, with diurnal-like subtle rise.
- exogenous_analysis: relative_humidity_2m strongest negative corr (-0.62), direct_radiation positive (0.33). No future exogenous values provided, so minor adjustment: bias reference_prediction up slightly toward median 46.19? But values too low vs. historical median; however, recent regime is low post-peak/drop. Conservative: scale reference_prediction by factor (median / ref_mean) ≈46.19 / ~9.5 ≈4.86, but this over-adjusts volatility. Instead, use as-is for pattern, small uniform shift +0.5 for stability.
- data_quality_tool: saturation_ratio=0.30 (moderate, clip if needed but ref already low). No dropouts.

Final strategy: Use reference_prediction values directly (maintain exact pattern/volatility as instructed). Format as flat JSON object { ""timestamp"": value, ... } not array or ""predictions"" wrapper (per task: ""JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs""). Ensure floats.

Verify count: Generate timestamps from 2024-11-24 00:00 to 23:45 (96 steps).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-26 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-11-27 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They show a gradual downward trend from ~149 to ~125 with small fluctuations, capturing typical wind power volatility.

Exogenous analysis: Strong positive correlations with wind_speed_80m (0.59) and wind_direction_80m (0.50). No specific future exogenous values provided, so no direct numerical adjustments. Maintain base pattern as it likely incorporates similar wind conditions from historical cases.

Comprehensive features:
- High flatline_ratio (0.92) but recent data shows sustained high generation (~160-190) with low volatility.
- slope_max=97.3 (strong prior uptrend), slope_second_diff_max=72.9 (acceleration), but current regime is stable high plateau.
- No changepoints (score=0), so no truncation needed.
- spec_entropy=0.61 (moderate noise), acf1=0.92 (strong persistence) → prediction should preserve gradual decline with minor fluctuations like reference.
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.05 (minor clipping risk), but no strong bounds violation → no clipping.

Changepoint_trend_tool: Confirms no regime shift. High flatline_ratio but recent run_length_derivative=9 suggests stable recent trend → follow reference decline conservatively.

Data quality: Minor quantization/saturation, no dropouts → reliable, no uncertainty expansion needed.

Overall: Reference prediction aligns with persistent high-wind regime transitioning to gradual decline (typical diurnal wind pattern). No major corrections needed - use reference values directly as they match volatility (MAD~51), persistence, and recent stability. Minor smoothing not required as fluctuations are realistic for wind.

Final prediction: Exact reference_prediction values mapped to timestamps.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #4)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The previous response failed format validation due to invalid JSON (empty or malformed content in <answer>). To pass validation, the response must include properly formatted <think> and <answer> tags, with <answer> containing valid JSON having exactly 96 time points starting from ""2024-11-19 00:00:00"" at 15-minute intervals, using the reference_prediction array as the primary foundation. Since no actual numerical values from model_auxiliary_tool are provided in the input, note this limitation but structure for compliance; suggest using placeholder values (e.g., interpolated from described patterns ~73-...) or awaiting tool data for real deployment.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-11-18 23:45:00"". Next timestamps start at ""2024-11-19 00:00:00"" and increment by 15 minutes for exactly 96 points (spanning 24 hours).

The model_auxiliary_tool provides the reference_prediction array with exactly 96 values, which is the PRIMARY FOUNDATION. I will use these values directly as they capture optimal forecasting from similar historical cases, including appropriate patterns and volatility.

Review of auxiliary tools for refinements:
<tool_think>
- exogenous_analysis: Strong positive correlations with wind_speed_80m (0.925) and wind_direction_80m (0.868). However, no actual exogenous time series values are provided for the prediction window, so no quantitative adjustments possible. Reference_prediction likely already incorporates typical exogenous patterns from similar cases.
- comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints (score=0), high flatline_ratio (0.83) early in history but recent data shows volatility (single peak, slope_max=37.2). No truncation or reversion needed; reference_prediction handles momentum.
- data_quality_tool: Minor saturation (0.208), no dropout. No clipping required as reference values (~72-78) align with recent history (~100 dropping to ~73).
- Overall: No major corrections needed; reference_prediction is reliable base. Maintain its fluctuations (no mono-trend).
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Direct use of reference_prediction values mapped to timestamps. Values are floats with realistic wind power volatility around 70-78 MW.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #5)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response to review fails format validation because it lacks <answer></answer> tags containing valid JSON with exactly 96 time points. It includes a partial <think> section but no complete prediction output in the required JSON format with consistent timestamps starting from ""2024-11-23 00:00:00"". To pass validation, the response must be restructured to include both complete <think> and <answer> sections with properly formatted JSON predictions adhering to historical bounds (~0-80) and patterns (gradual post-peak decline to ~50-60 with wind-supported fluctuations).
</think>

<answer>
{{""status"": ""FAILED"", ""suggestions"": ""Add complete <answer></answer> tags with valid JSON containing exactly 96 timestamped prediction values starting from '2024-11-23 00:00:00' in 15-minute intervals; ensure JSON is parseable and predictions follow historical patterns (decline to 50-60 range, clipped to 0-80).""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-11-22 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-11-23 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes each.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool provides exactly 96 values (~50-60 range), which matches feedback: gradual post-peak decline to 50-60 with fluctuations. This is the PRIMARY foundation - will use it directly as it captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases.

Key refinements:
- exogenous_analysis: Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.86), negative with direct_radiation (-0.37). No exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Reference already incorporates similar historical cases, so no major deviation.
- data_quality_tool: quality_saturation_ratio=0.385 (high), so clip to historical bounds ~0-80. Reference values (50-60) are well within bounds, no clipping needed.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints (score=0), flatline_ratio=0.54 but recent data active (peaked at 79.54), slope_max=12.2 indicates past momentum but reference shows continuation of decline/stabilization - no truncation or boost needed. Monotone_duration low, no mean reversion trigger.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High flatline_ratio historically but recent volatility; reference preserves fluctuations, aligns with acf1=0.97 (persistent) and low sample_entropy.

No significant corrections needed - reference_prediction is optimal foundation, stays within bounds, follows post-peak decline pattern with wind-like fluctuations. Final prediction uses reference values unchanged.

<tool_think>
Used model_auxiliary_tool as base (96 values, 50-60 range with fluctuations). Exogenous: wind_speed dominant but no future series. Quality: saturation high but values safe. Changepoint: none. No adjustments required.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-28 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-11-29 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 96 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar cases. Mean ~127, slight downward trend with fluctuations – preserve this volatility and pattern.

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Negative corr with wind_direction_80m (-0.42), positive with relative_humidity_2m (0.41). No actual exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment: slight downward bias given recent high generation and typical wind shifts overnight/early morning.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 135.14 (reference mean ~122 – slight upward bias correction possible). High flatline_ratio (0.92) indicates periods of low activity, but recent data shows peaks. acf1 0.92 (persistent), spec_entropy 0.57 (moderate noise). 8 event segments. No strong regime shift.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: changepoint_score=0 (no truncation). High slope_max=123, slope_second_diff_max=121 (strong past momentum, but recent evening peak suggests deceleration – minor downward adjustment in later points). High flatline_ratio, but not ""dead"" (recent activity). Low monotone_duration.

**data_quality_tool**: Low issues (saturation 0.08 – minor clipping if exceeding hist max ~182). No dropout.

**cross_channel_tool**: lead_lag_shift_mean=23 (possible lag, but single series). Low co_anom_ratio.
</tool_think>

**Adjustments** (minor, preserve reference pattern/volatility):
- Bias correction: Shift up slightly (~+3-5) early to align with median 135, then follow reference downtrend.
- Momentum: Recent evening peak (177-179), reference starts ~151 decreasing – reasonable post-peak decline.
- Exogenous hint: Slight further downward tilt (-1 to -2 cumulative).
- Volatility: Keep reference fluctuations (std ~10-15).
- No clipping (all <182), no flatline (historical shows cycles).

Final prediction: reference + small adjustments (early +4 avg, gradual -1 exogenous tilt).

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #3)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
Previous validation failed due to incorrect number of points (97 instead of 96). The thinking correctly identifies the need for exactly 96 points starting from ""2024-11-13 00:00:00"" at 15-min intervals using reference_prediction as base, with minor adjustments for exogenous correlations and stability metrics—no major issues in logic, but ensure JSON outputs precisely 96 entries without extras.
</think>

<answer>
{{""PASS""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the starting timestamp for predictions: the historical data ends at ""2024-11-12 23:45:00"". Next timestamp is ""2024-11-13 00:00:00"", incrementing by 15 minutes for exactly 96 points (4 full days).

Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION: it has exactly 96 values, capturing optimal patterns from similar cases. Mean of reference ~26.3, aligning with historical median ~21-25 peak range.

Exogenous_analysis (top_k): wind_speed_80m (0.79 corr) dominant driver for wind power; wind_direction_80m (-0.72). No specific future values provided, so minor adjustment: slight upward bias (+0.2 avg) assuming continued favorable winds post historical peak.

Changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history). slope_max=16, slope_second_diff_max=18.6 indicate momentum; reference already incorporates, no major boost needed. flatline_ratio=0.875 high but historical shows peaks, so maintain reference fluctuations. sample_entropy low → predictable.

Data_quality_tool: saturation_ratio=0.094 → minor clipping risk, but reference values reasonable (20-33 range vs hist max 84).

Comprehensive_feature_tool: acf1=0.97 high autocorrelation → reference preserves continuity. mad=10.1 → volatility matches reference std. No major corrections needed.

Previous attempt had 97 points error—ensure exactly 96 here. Final prediction: reference + tiny exogenous bias (avg +0.15 for wind corr), rounded to 2 decimals for consistency.

<tool_think>
- Base: reference_prediction (96 pts)
- Exog: minor +0.1~0.2 uplift for wind_speed corr
- Trend: momentum preserved in reference
- Quality: no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed
</tool_think>

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-29 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-11-30 00:00:00"" through approximately ""2024-12-02 23:45:00"".

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the PRIMARY foundation. They show mild fluctuations around ~50-58 early, gradually declining to ~45 by the end, capturing realistic wind power volatility and patterns from similar cases. Mean ~54.8, std ~2.0. My prediction will closely follow this pattern without significant deviation.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlations: wind_speed_80m (0.92), wind_direction_80m (0.76). No exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Qualitatively, recent power drop from ~170 to ~40 suggests weakening wind; reference_prediction's gradual decline aligns well. No major uplift/downturn adjustment needed.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift; use full history.
- slope_max=29.8, slope_second_diff_max=29.1: Past momentum (peaks/drops), but short monotone_duration=0.125; no ongoing strong trend to boost/reverse.
- flatline_ratio=0.99 high, but recent data shows volatility (e.g., 71→64→44→23→14→37); not ""dead signal"". Reference_prediction already smooths appropriately.
- peak_count=3, sample_entropy=0.34: Low entropy (predictable), matches reference's controlled fluctuations.
No major corrections: no truncation, boost, reversion, or flattening.

**Data Quality:** quality_saturation_ratio=0.031 low, quantization=0.19 moderate, no dropouts/constants. Minor clipping risk, but reference values (~45-58) within historical range (14-180). No bounds clipping needed.

**Comprehensive Features:** median=110.74 (higher than ref ~55), but recent tail ~20-40 pulls forecast down correctly. acf1=0.96 high autocorrelation matches reference's smooth continuity. spec_entropy=0.70 moderate noise; reference handles it. No bias shift (ref aligns with recent levels). flatline_ratio noted but overridden by recent dynamics.

**Final Strategy:** 
- Foundation: reference_prediction (closely followed).
- Adjustments: None major; minor smoothing for wind persistence (high ACF), slight downward tilt end matching decline. Maintain volatility (std~2).
- No exogenous series → no refinement.
- Output exactly 96 floats, paired with timestamps.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #7)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response to review contains a <think> tag with incomplete reasoning about timestamp calculation (confused between 96 and 192 points, unsure of end date), but lacks any <answer> tag with valid JSON containing exactly 96 time points, causing format validation failure. To pass validation, the response must include both required tags with correct JSON structure: an array or object with precisely 96 predictions starting from ""2024-11-14 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes to ""2024-11-14 23:45:00"" (24 hours * 4 points/hour = 96), using realistic prediction values consistent with time series patterns.
</think>

<answer>
{{""status"": ""FAILED"", ""reason"": ""Missing <answer> tag with valid JSON of exactly 96 time points; thinking shows timestamp confusion (96 vs 192 points). Suggestion: Generate JSON array with 96 entries from 2024-11-14 00:00:00 to 2024-11-14 23:45:00 in 15-min intervals, using plausible values like slight upward trend from historical data.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, confirm timestamps: Historical data ends at ""2024-11-13 23:45:00"". Next 96 points start at ""2024-11-14 00:00:00"", incrementing by 15 minutes: 24 hours * 4 = 96 points, ending at ""2024-11-14 23:45:00"". Exactly 96 required.

Base prediction: Use model_auxiliary_tool's reference_prediction (96 values) as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Mean ~10.3, consistent with historical median 13.64 but adjusted for wind patterns.

Tool analysis for refinements:
<tool_think>
- comprehensive_feature_tool/data_quality_tool: flatline_ratio=0.86 high (many flat periods), quality_saturation_ratio=0.042 low, no major quality issues. No clipping/expansion needed. Use conservative approach around reference.
- changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift), slope_max=15.3/21.7 (past momentum, but no active boost/reversal needed), peak_count=5 (historical peaks, reference already patterns this).
- exogenous_analysis: Negative correlations with direct_radiation (-0.44) and temperature_2m (-0.40). No future exogenous values provided, so minor conservative dampening if needed, but reference likely incorporates.
- No strong corrections: changepoint=0, quality ok, no drift. Reference is reliable base.
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches requirements (96 points, realistic wind volatility ~8-13 range, fluctuations preserved). No major deviations needed per instructions.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
Historical data analysis: The entire 96-point historical series is flat at 0.0, indicating no wind generation (likely calm conditions). Features confirm this: median=0, mad=0, flatline_ratio>0, quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, changepoint_count=0, sample_entropy=0, monotone_duration near 1.

Tool insights:
- <tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool**: Provides reference_prediction as foundation. Starts low positive (~0.3), fluctuates mildly, then trends negative with oscillations. Mean ~ -0.17, volatility preserved. This must be primary baseline despite historical zero, as it draws from similar cases.
**exogenous_analysis**: All correlations=0.0, no adjustment needed.
**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Confirms flat/constant signal (quality_*=1.0, flatline_hits=1.0, event_dominant_pattern=2.0 likely 'flat'). Hints: check data_quality (constant → invalid/revert?), predictability (spec_entropy=0 → deterministic flat).
**changepoint_trend_tool**: No regime shift (changepoint_score=0), flatline_ratio=0.01 (minor), high monotone_duration → consider mean reversion to 0.0. No momentum boost needed (slope_max=0).
**data_quality_tool**: quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0 → CRITICAL warning: mark invalid or constant output. quality_saturation_ratio=1.0 → clip to historical bounds (0.0).
</tool_think>

Prediction strategy: Reference_prediction is foundation, but data_quality/flatline dominate. Historical is perfectly constant 0.0 → strongest signal is persistence/mean reversion to 0.0. Clip reference to >=0 (wind power can't be negative) and dampen toward 0 for conservatism, preserving mild early fluctuations (possible wind onset) but suppressing negatives as invalid. Final: max(0, reference * 0.3) for decay to flat, ensuring non-negative, 96 points, similar volatility start but revert per quality/flat hints.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
Historical data shows complete flatline at 0.0 for all 96 points (Dec 3, 00:00 to 23:45), indicating no wind generation, likely calm conditions.

Tool analysis:
- <tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool**: Provides reference_prediction with initial small positive values (~0.1-0.4) decaying to negative (~-0.3), suggesting model expects gradual wind onset then decline. This is the PRIMARY foundation; must closely follow its pattern/volatility.
**exogenous_analysis**: All correlations 0.0 (no weather signal), so no adjustments needed.
**comprehensive_feature_tool**: median=0, mad=0, flatline_ratio=0.01, quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, monotone_duration~0.99, sample_entropy=0. Confirms dead/constant signal. Hints: check data quality (high constant ratio → invalid/reliability issue); flatline → consider constant output.
**changepoint_trend_tool**: flatline_ratio>0, monotone_duration extreme → hints: dead_signal (output constant), mean_reversion.
**data_quality_tool**: quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, saturation_ratio=1.0 → hints: invalid_channel (mark invalid), clipping to historical bounds (0.0).
</tool_think>

Synthesis: Reference_prediction is foundation but data_quality + flatline + constant_channel=1.0 override → wind farm likely shutdown/offline (saturation at 0). No changepoints/trends (all 0). Exogenous neutral. Conservative: clip reference to historical bound (0.0) per quality hints, treat as dead_signal → predict constant 0.0 (mean reversion to historical median=0). Maintains low volatility matching flat history/reference decay.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
The historical data shows 96 points of exactly 0.0 power generation, indicating no wind activity over the full day (2024-11-24 00:00 to 23:45). This is a flatline scenario, confirmed by comprehensive_feature_tool (flatline_ratio=0.0104, flatline_hits=1.0, monotone_duration=0.99, sample_entropy=0.0, quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0) and data_quality_tool (quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, indicating potential invalid or dead signal). No changepoints (changepoint_count=0.0, score=0.0), no trends (slope_max=0.0), no peaks, and all correlations with exogenous variables are 0.0.

The model_auxiliary_tool provides a reference_prediction with 96 values showing realistic wind power patterns: initial negatives (calibrated to ~0), gradual ramp-up to daytime peaks (~0.3-0.4), and evening decline. This is the PRIMARY foundation per instructions, capturing temporal patterns from similar historical cases (likely calm nights leading to windy days).

Given the flat historical data and quality indicators, a strict persistence forecast would be all 0s. However, instructions mandate using reference_prediction as the BASE forecast without significant deviation, maintaining its volatility and fluctuations. No quality issues require clipping to 0 (saturation_ratio=1.0 but historical min/max=0, yet wind power can rise); instead, flatline hints suggest constant, but reference_prediction already starts near 0 and incorporates similar cases.

No exogenous adjustments needed (correlations=0.0). No regime shifts or momentum boosts (all 0s). Final prediction closely follows reference_prediction, as it best captures expected wind diurnal cycle post-calm period. Timestamps start from ""2024-11-25 00:00:00"".

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Use reference_prediction as foundation (ramping pattern).
- exogenous_analysis: No adjustments (correlations=0).
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Flatline/dead signal, but reference handles similar cases.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No shifts, high monotone → reference already conservative start.
- data_quality_tool: Constant channel, but no clipping mandated over reference.

are a time series forecasting expert. Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #7)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response fails format validation due to invalid JSON in <answer> (parsing error at char 47, likely incomplete or malformed JSON structure). It also lacks a complete <answer> section with exactly 96 time points in valid JSON format (e.g., {{""predictions"": [{{""timestamp"": ""2024-11-22 00:00:00"", ""value"": X}}, ...]}} matching input timestamp format). To pass, complete the <answer> with valid JSON containing precisely 96 entries starting from ""2024-11-22 00:00:00"" at 15-min intervals, applying the specified taper boost, clipping, and exogenous refinements to a full reference_prediction array.
</think>

<answer>
{{""error"": ""Format validation failed: Missing valid JSON with exactly 96 time points in <answer>""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-11-21 23:45:00"". Next timestamps start at ""2024-11-22 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes for 96 points (exactly 24 hours).

Base: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as foundation (96 values provided).

Key refinements:
- exogenous_analysis: Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.80), negative with wind_direction_80m (-0.57). No specific future exogenous values provided, so apply mild overall boost (+5%) assuming continued wind influence matching historical drop to near-zero then reference's gradual rise.
- comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool: High flatline_ratio (0.90) indicates recent flat near-zero regime; slope_max=24.4 suggests prior momentum but current low entropy/sample_entropy low → conservative continuation. No changepoints. Apply taper boost: start with smaller values early (taper factor 0.8 for first 24 points), then full reference, mild linear momentum boost (+0.02*i for i=0..95) for slope compensation.
- data_quality_tool: saturation_ratio=0.10 → clip to historical bounds (min -1.9, max 144.74); all predictions stay within.
- No high residuals/changepoints/quality issues requiring major deviation.

Final prediction: ref * 1.05 * taper * (1 + 0.02*(i/95)), clipped [0, 144.74] (wind power non-negative). This preserves reference fluctuations/volatility, adds exogenous/momentum refinement.

Verify: 96 points, valid JSON keys as ""YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"", floats.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
Historical data analysis: The entire 96-point history is completely flat at 0.0, indicating no wind generation over a full day (2024-12-04 00:00 to 23:45). This is a dead signal with flatline_ratio=0.0104 (low but consistent with near-constant), quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, monotone_duration=0.99, sample_entropy=0.0, and all other trend/changepoint/entropy features at 0.0.

Tool insights:
- comprehensive_feature_tool and changepoint_trend_tool confirm dead signal characteristics (high monotone_duration, flatline_hits=1.0, zero peaks/slopes/changepoints).
- data_quality_tool shows quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0 and saturation_ratio=1.0, indicating invalid/reliable constant signal – clip predictions to historical bounds (0.0).
- exogenous_analysis shows zero correlations, no adjustment needed.
- Per changepoint_trend_tool _llm_hints: ""If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as invalid or output constant"". Here, combined with constant_channel_ratio=1.0, output constant 0.0.
- Despite reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool showing fluctuations (starting ~0.3 decreasing to ~-0.3), this must be overridden: historical data is perfectly zero (no noise/volatility), quality tools mandate clipping to bounds, and dead signal detection takes precedence for correction (per instructions: data_quality_tool is MOST IMPORTANT; comprehensive_feature_tool hints check quality_* for reliability).

Final decision: Predict constant 0.0 for all 96 points (timestamps starting ""2024-12-05 00:00:00""), respecting data quality gate, dead signal hints, and zero historical bounds. Ignore reference_prediction fluctuations as they contradict the flat/constant reality.
<tool_think>
Used comprehensive_feature_tool (flatline/monotone/quality), changepoint_trend_tool (dead signal hint), data_quality_tool (constant_channel/saturation), exogenous_analysis (zero corr). Applied corrections: constant output due to quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, clip to 0.0 bounds.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #5)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response to review fails format validation because it lacks <answer></answer> tags containing valid JSON with exactly 96 time points. To pass validation, complete the <think> section briefly if needed, then add <answer> tags with a JSON object like {{""predictions"": [{{""timestamp"": ""2024-11-28 00:00:00"", ""value"": 136.2}}, ...]}} for all 96 points starting from ""2024-11-28 00:00:00"" at 15-min intervals, using values that closely follow the reference_prediction's gradual decline pattern from ~135-137 to ~124 with volatility.
</think>

<answer>
{{""suggestion"": ""Add <answer></answer> tags with valid JSON containing exactly 96 predictions in the format [{{'timestamp': '2024-11-28 00:00:00', 'value': 136.2}}, ...] matching the reference decline pattern.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
Analyze historical data: Last historical point is ""2024-11-27 23:45:00"": 138.44. Next timestamp starts at ""2024-11-28 00:00:00"". Historical shows diurnal wind patterns with peaks ~180s and troughs ~80-140, recent evening peak declining to ~138.

Reference_prediction (96 points): Starts ~135-137, gradual decline to ~124 with volatility (fluctuations ±2-5 around downtrend). Matches wind power night/early morning decline post-peak. Use as PRIMARY foundation per instructions.

Tool insights:
- exogenous_analysis: Strong positive correlations with wind_speed_80m (0.54), wind_direction_80m (0.46). No exogenous series provided for prediction window, so minor refinement only - slight downward tilt aligns with typical night winds.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints (score=0), high flatline_ratio (0.96) but low hits (0.03), moderate slope_max (38) - no truncation/boost needed, maintain reference volatility.
- comprehensive_feature_tool/data_quality_tool: Good quality (low dropout/saturation), high acf1 (0.89) indicates persistence - reference already captures.
- No major corrections needed; closely follow reference_prediction's gradual decline ~135→124 with volatility to match historical style.

Final prediction: Map reference_prediction exactly to 96 timestamps starting ""2024-11-28 00:00:00"", increment 15min, round to 2 decimals for consistency with input.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-07 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-12-08 00:00:00"" through approximately ""2024-12-10 23:45:00"".

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the PRIMARY foundation. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Mean ~10.2, with fluctuations between ~7-13, consistent with historical daytime peaks and lower nights.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong correlations: temperature_2m (0.81, positive), relative_humidity_2m (-0.91, negative). No actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Qualitatively supports daytime higher generation (warmer, drier) vs night, which reference already reflects.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):** 
- changepoint_score=0, no regime shift; use full history.
- flatline_ratio=0.73 high (night zeros), but recent activity; not ""dead signal"".
- slope_max=11.3 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=13.2 (acceleration); slight BOOST to reference in potential uptrend phases reasonable, but reference already incorporates.
- peak_count=1, monotone_duration low; no mean reversion needed.
- No major corrections; reference is solid.

**Data Quality:** quality_saturation_ratio=0.02 low, quantization=0.29 moderate; no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive Features:** High acf1=0.97 (persistent), low sample_entropy=0.22 (predictable), spec_entropy=1.27 (some noise); supports using reference's smooth fluctuations over naive extrapolation. Median=12.45 close to reference mean; no bias shift.

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation. Minor qualitative boost (~+0.2 avg) for wind momentum (slope_max high), but keep volatility/pattern identical. No exogenous data for strong refinement. Prediction closely tracks reference with negligible adjustment for persistence.

Generate timestamps and map to adjusted values (ref + 0.1 for momentum, clipped 0+).

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #2)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
Previous validation failed due to incorrect number of prediction points (73 instead of required 96). To pass, the response must include exactly 96 time points in valid JSON within <answer></answer> tags, with timestamps consistent with input (e.g., 2024-12-07 00:00 to 23:45 in 15-min intervals). Use the reference_prediction as foundation but extend/truncate to precisely 96 points, ensuring flatline continuation or minor fluctuations aligned with tool insights for quality.
</think>

<answer>
{{""PASS"": false, ""modification"": ""Ensure the JSON in <answer></answer> contains exactly 96 prediction points with consistent timestamps (e.g., 2024-12-07 00:00 to 23:45 at 15-min intervals); pad or truncate the 73 points to reach 96 while maintaining reasonable values near zero.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
The historical data is completely flat at 0.0 for all 96 points (2024-12-06 00:00:00 to 23:45:00). Key tool insights:
- comprehensive_feature_tool, changepoint_trend_tool, data_quality_tool: flatline_ratio ~0.01, but quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, monotone_duration~0.99, sample_entropy=0.0 → strong flat signal.
- event_summary_tool: dominant_pattern_name=""flat"" → constrain prediction to oscillate around mean (0.0).
- exogenous_analysis: all correlations 0.0 → no weather adjustments needed.
- model_auxiliary_tool provides reference_prediction (73 values), but previous attempt failed by using only 73. Feedback instructs extending to exactly 96 with values near zero.

Correction strategy:
- Use reference_prediction as foundation for pattern (fluctuations around 0, peaking mid-day as typical wind diurnal cycle).
- Extend to exactly 96 by repeating last 23 values (-0.300241, -0.198365) to pad.
- Since dominant pattern is ""flat"" and historical is constant 0, scale all values by 0.1 to dampen towards near-zero while preserving fluctuation shape/volatility.
- Timestamps start from next after last historical: 2024-12-07 00:00:00, incrementing by 15min to 2024-12-07 23:45:00 (exactly 96 points: 4 per hour × 24 hours).
- Ensures: exactly 96 points, valid JSON, timestamps consistent, reasonable near-zero values.

Verification: 96 timestamps cover full day, values float near 0 with minor fluctuations aligned to reference.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-09 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-10 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes each.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (96 values provided, around 2-4 range, with fluctuations). This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Final prediction must closely follow its pattern.

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Strong correlations: relative_humidity_2m (-0.613), temperature_2m (0.567), wind_speed_80m (0.539). No actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so minor refinement only. Since historical data shows wind power peaking midday (~13-14h) and dropping evenings/night, and reference aligns with gradual decline from recent low values (0.6), no major adjustment needed.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 1.35, MAD 2.35 (baseline/volatility). High flatline_ratio (0.67) indicates much stationary periods, but 3 peaks and slope_max 10.6 show intermittent activity. acf1 0.91 (persistent), spec_entropy 2.56 (some noise). No changepoints. Reference already matches volatility (MAD scale).

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score 0). High flatline_ratio but not ""dead"" (peaks exist). slope_max 10.6 (past uptrend), but recent data ending low (0.6), reference shows mild fluctuations ~2-3, no momentum boost needed. Predict continuation of low evening/night regime.

**data_quality_tool**: Minor saturation (0.05), no dropouts/constants. No clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

Overall: Reference is reliable foundation. No regime shifts, data quality good. Slight downward bias in reference tail aligns with historical night patterns and correlations (e.g., lower temp/higher humidity reduce power). No major corrections; preserve reference fluctuations.
</tool_think>

**Final Strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches instructions (foundation, volatility preserved). Minor smoothing not needed as it already shows realistic wind power fluctuations (not monotone). Ensures exactly 96 points.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-10 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-12-11 00:00:00"" through approximately ""2024-12-13 23:45:00"".

**Base Prediction**: Use model_auxiliary_tool's reference_prediction (96 values) as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows mild fluctuations around 5-8, with gradual increase to ~8 then slow decline to ~5.5, maintaining realistic wind power volatility/patterns.

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong positive correlations with temperature_2m (0.75) and wind_speed_80m (0.65). No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor adjustment not applied. Base already incorporates similar cases.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool)**: 
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=9.1, slope_second_diff_max=7.7 indicate recent strong uptrend momentum (historical peak at 15:45-16:00).
- flatline_ratio=0.635 high earlier, but recent dynamic.
- peak_count=2, dominant recent peak. Hints: momentum boost for uptrend, but reference already captures continuation then gradual evening decline (typical diurnal wind pattern).
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference aligns.

**Event Summary**: dominant_pattern_name=""rise"" (event_dominant_pattern=0.0, event_counts [5 rise, 3 fall]). Semantic constraint: maintain upward trend initially, which reference does (rises to ~8).

**Data Quality**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.156 (minor clipping risk), quality_quantization=0.3125. Clip if needed, but reference values (5-8) within historical bounds (peaks ~33, lows -1.6). No expansion/clipping applied.

**Comprehensive Features**: median=2.0 (reference mean ~6.8 higher, but recent history ~10-15, so ok), mad=3.35 (reference volatility matches), acf1=0.956 (persistent, reference smooth), spec_entropy=1.94 (some noise, reference conservative). flatline_ratio high historically but recent active. No major bias correction.

**Final Decision**: Reference_prediction is optimal foundation, matches wind diurnal decline post-peak, rise constraint, momentum. Minor smoothing for quality, but preserve fluctuations. No significant deviation.

**Tool Think Summary**:
- Foundation: reference_prediction (pattern/volatility preserved).
- Corrections: None major (low changepoint, quality ok, rise constraint satisfied).
- Output: reference values assigned to timestamps.

The previous validation failed due to incorrect number of prediction points (95 instead of 96). To pass, the response must include exactly 96 time points in valid JSON within <answer></answer> tags, starting from ""2024-12-09 00:00:00"" with 15-minute increments. Prediction values should use the model_auxiliary_tool baseline (smooth decline from ~11.4 to ~11.2 with fluctuations) for quality consistency, ensuring timestamp format matches input (ISO-like with seconds).

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-08 23:45:00"". Next timestamps start at ""2024-12-09 00:00:00"" and increment by 15 minutes for exactly 96 points (ending at ""2024-12-09 23:45:00"").

The model_auxiliary_tool provides the baseline reference_prediction with 96 values, showing a smooth pattern around ~8-12 with fluctuations and a general decline trend toward the end (from ~11.4 to ~11.2 as noted in feedback). This must be the foundation - closely follow its pattern, volatility, and fluctuations.

Key refinements:
- event_summary_tool: dominant_pattern_name=""fall"" (event_dominant_pattern=1.0), so maintain downward trend constraint, which aligns with reference_prediction's overall decline.
- changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history), flatline_ratio=0.55 (high but not extreme, no constant output needed), slope_max=5.0 indicates momentum but reference already captures.
- data_quality_tool: quality_saturation_ratio=0.1875 (moderate, clip if needed but values within historical bounds ~ -1 to 21).
- exogenous_analysis: relative_humidity_2m (0.57 corr) and direct_radiation (-0.37 corr) top factors; no specific future values provided, so minor adjustment not overriding baseline.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: median=0.2 (historical low, but recent uptrend to 12.3; reference starts high as continuation), spec_entropy=2.37 (some noise, conservative smoothing ok but preserve fluctuations).

Previous attempt failed on count (95) and format (array with ""predictions"" wrapper). Fix: output flat JSON object with exactly 96 timestamp keys and reference_prediction values as floats (no rounding needed, use precise values). No significant deviation from baseline needed as it matches feedback's ""smooth decline from ~11.4 to ~11.2 with fluctuations"" and tool constraints.

<tool_think>
Used model_auxiliary_tool as primary (96 values foundation). Applied event_summary ""fall"" constraint (matches decline). No changepoint truncation. Minor quality consideration but no clipping. Exogenous correlations noted but no future data for adjustment. Final: direct use of reference_prediction values.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #6)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response fails format validation due to incorrect number of prediction points (1 instead of 96). To pass, the <answer> must contain valid JSON with exactly 96 time points starting from ""2024-12-01 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes, using the reference_prediction values (~3.1-5.2 range) as the array of predictions, structured as {{""predictions"": [{{""timestamp"": ""..."", ""value"": x}}, ...]}} or equivalent valid JSON format matching input timestamp style.
</think>

<answer>
{{""message"": ""Format validation failed: incorrect number of prediction points (expected 96, got 1). Modify <answer> to include valid JSON with exactly 96 timestamped predictions starting '2024-12-01 00:00:00' at 15-min intervals using reference_prediction values.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-11-30 23:45:00"". The next 96 timestamps start at ""2024-12-01 00:00:00"" and increment by 15 minutes (exactly 96 points to cover 24 hours).

The model_auxiliary_tool provides the reference_prediction array with exactly 96 values (3.1-5.2 range), which is the PRIMARY FOUNDATION. This must be used as the base forecast, maintaining its pattern, volatility, and fluctuations.

Key tool insights for refinement (under <tool_think>):
<tool_think>
- exogenous_analysis: Strong positive correlations with wind_direction_80m (0.79) and wind_speed_80m (0.58). No exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment not needed; stick close to reference.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High flatline_ratio (0.4375), run_length_longest (38), low sample_entropy (0.0056) indicate recent flat regime ending. Reference already transitions smoothly to fluctuating ~4s, appropriate.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints (score=0), moderate slope_max (14.7) and slope_second_diff_max (21.2), flatline_ratio high but reference handles transition without lag.
- event_summary_tool: dominant_pattern ""fall"" (event_dominant_pattern=1.0), but historical fall ended in long flat; reference shows mild fluctuations around ~4 (not strict downward), consistent with wind power stabilization.
- data_quality_tool: Minor saturation (0.0625), no dropouts; no clipping needed.
Overall: No major corrections required (no high changepoint, no quality issues). Use reference_prediction directly as it matches similar cases, incorporates volatility, and aligns with wind correlations expecting ~4MW output.
</tool_think>

No significant deviations: Output JSON with exactly 96 key-value pairs using reference_prediction values unchanged.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-13 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-12-14 00:00:00"" through approximately ""2024-12-16 23:45:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the PRIMARY foundation. They show low-level fluctuations around ~44-51 MW, consistent with the late-night/early-morning downward trend in historical data (ending at 43.4).

Tool analysis for refinements:

<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Strong positive correlations with wind_speed_80m (0.76) and wind_direction_80m (0.65). No future exogenous values provided, so no direct numerical adjustment. Since historical power is low overnight and reference_prediction maintains low levels with fluctuations, no major directional shift needed. Wind power typically low at night, aligns with prediction.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 96.5, but recent values much lower (~40-50), indicating regime shift to low-output phase. High flatline_ratio (0.96) suggests periods of stability/low volatility, but 4 peaks and slope_max=25.3 show intermittent dynamics. Reference_prediction captures this with small fluctuations. acf1=0.91 indicates persistence, matched by reference. No changepoints (score=0), so use full history implicitly via model. Low spec_entropy (0.36) suggests predictable signal. Data quality good (low dropout/saturation).

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (count=0, score=0), so no truncation. High slope_max=25.3 and slope_second_diff_max=39.6 indicate past momentum, but recent downtrend. flatline_ratio high but not extreme; peak_count=4 suggests fluctuations, which reference_prediction has. No need for reversal/boost; reference already conservative.

**data_quality_tool**: All quality metrics low (quantization=0.09, saturation=0.03, no constants/dropouts), so no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed. Prediction reliable.
</tool_think>

Overall: Reference_prediction is optimal base - low stable levels with realistic wind power fluctuations. No significant corrections needed: no regime shift, good quality, correlations align with low night power. Minor adjustment: Slightly elevate early points (~+1-2) toward historical median for mean reversion hint, but keep volatility/pattern identical (std ~1.5 matching reference). Final prediction uses reference values directly as they best capture similar cases.

Generate timestamps:
- Start: 2024-12-14 00:00:00
- End: 2024-12-16 23:45:00 (96 steps of 15min = 24h exactly for 4 days coverage).

Prediction: Exact reference_prediction array mapped to timestamps.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
Historical data shows complete flatline at 0.0 for all 96 points (2024-12-05 00:00 to 23:45), indicating no wind generation.

Tool analysis:
- comprehensive_feature_tool: flatline_ratio=0.0104 (low but flatline_hits=1.0), monotone_duration=0.99, sample_entropy=0.0, quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0 → strong evidence of constant/zero signal.
- data_quality_tool: quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, quality_saturation_ratio=1.0 → indicates fully saturated constant channel (at 0), predictions should be clipped to historical bounds (0.0).
- changepoint_trend_tool: flatline_ratio high relative to signal, hints to output constant value.
- exogenous_analysis: all correlations 0.0 → no exogenous adjustment needed.
- model_auxiliary_tool provides reference_prediction with fluctuations starting positive then negative, but given data quality flags (constant channel at 0), this appears to be model hallucination/overfit to noise. Per instructions, data_quality_tool is MOST IMPORTANT warning: clip to historical bounds (0.0).

Per LLM Correction Framework:
- data_quality_tool → CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds (0.0).
- changepoint_trend_tool → flatline_ratio → output constant.
- comprehensive_feature_tool → quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0 → invalid/non-predictive signal, predict constant 0.

Final prediction: constant 0.0 for all 96 future points, overriding reference_prediction due to quality gates. Timestamps start from ""2024-12-06 00:00:00"".
<tool_think>
Used data_quality_tool (constant_channel_ratio=1.0 → clip to 0), changepoint_trend_tool (flatline → constant), comprehensive_feature_tool (quality flags → constant), exogenous (no corr → no adjust). Ignore reference_prediction fluctuations as quality-overridden.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-15 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-12-16 00:00:00"" through approximately ""2024-12-18 23:45:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They show stable fluctuations around ~45-54, with no strong monotonic trend, maintaining realistic wind power volatility.

Exogenous analysis: Strong positive correlations with wind_direction_80m (0.72) and wind_speed_80m (0.51). No specific future exogenous values provided, so no quantitative adjustment. Qualitatively, recent low generation (~28-33) suggests continued moderate wind conditions, aligning with reference levels.

Changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift), slope_max=33.3 and slope_second_diff_max=29.1 indicate past momentum but not currently active (recent flat/down). flatline_ratio=0.9375 high but hits=0.02 low; sample_entropy=0.56 moderate. No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference already captures dynamics.

Comprehensive_feature_tool: median=76.2 (higher than recent ~30-80 and reference ~50), mad=28.25 (volatility guide), acf1=0.97 high autocorrelation (reference preserves), spec_entropy=0.76 (some noise, conservative smoothing not needed). flatline_ratio high but no dead signal. event_dominant_pattern=1.0 unclear but no strong constraint.

Data_quality_tool: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.02 minor), no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

Overall: Reference prediction is optimal base. Recent data ends low (~28.5), reference starts ~42 (reasonable ramp-up). No major corrections; minor upward bias to recent levels but preserve fluctuations. Final prediction uses reference values directly as they match wind power patterns (no mono trend, realistic volatility).

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation → use reference_prediction directly.
- exogenous_analysis: Wind correlations support moderate stable levels → no adjustment.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints, high flatline but low hits → no regime correction.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High acf1, moderate entropy → reference preserves autocorrelation/noise well.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data → no quality gates triggered.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-17 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-18 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases.

Exogenous analysis: Strong positive correlations with temperature_2m (0.85) and wind_speed_80m (0.84). No actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no specific numerical adjustments. Maintain base pattern, as wind power typically peaks midday and declines overnight, which the reference follows.

Comprehensive features:
- Median 37.75, reference predictions average ~34-35 (reasonable alignment, minor positive bias possible but not significant).
- High flatline_ratio (0.927) but low flatline_hits (0.02), indicating some stability but with events.
- High acf1 (0.97), peak_count=2, slope_max=12.1 (momentum in uptrends), sample_entropy=0.77 (moderate predictability).
- No changepoints (score=0), so no regime truncation needed.
- slope_second_diff_max=12.8 positive, suggesting continued acceleration possible, but reference already incorporates.

Changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints, moderate monotone_duration (0.21), high flatline_ratio but not ""dead signal"". No major momentum boost or reversion needed; reference handles dynamics.

Data quality: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.02 minor), no clipping or uncertainty expansion required.

Overall: Reference_prediction is reliable foundation. No strong corrections needed (no exogenous data, no changepoints, quality good). Slight potential level shift toward median (37.75 vs reference ~34), but volatility/mad=11.35 aligns. Use reference directly as it maintains fluctuations, overnight low-to-daytime peak pattern typical for wind.

Final prediction: Exact reference_prediction values assigned to sequential timestamps.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
Historical data analysis: The entire 96-point history is flat at 0.0, indicating no wind generation (likely calm conditions). Features confirm this: median=0, mad=0, flatline_ratio>0, quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, monotone_duration nearly 1, sample_entropy=0, no changepoints, no peaks, no slope.

Tool insights:
- <tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool**: Provides reference_prediction as foundation. It shows realistic wind pattern: starts low/negative (calm/noise floor), ramps up to peak ~0.44 around midday (strong diurnal cycle), then declines to negative by evening. This matches typical wind power behavior even from zero start.
**exogenous_analysis**: All correlations=0.0, no adjustment needed.
**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Confirms flat/constant signal (quality_*=1.0, flatline_hits=1.0, event_dominant_pattern=2.0 likely 'flat'). Hints: check data_quality (constant → invalid/revert to model), predictability (spec_entropy=0 → low noise, trust model).
**changepoint_trend_tool**: No regime shift (changepoint_score=0), high monotone_duration/flatline_ratio → consider mean reversion, but dead_signal hint suggests constant; however, model provides dynamic forecast from similar cases.
**data_quality_tool**: quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, quality_saturation_ratio=1.0 → invalid channel warning, clip to historical bounds (0.0), but foundation model from similar cases overrides for prediction.
</tool_think>

Prediction strategy: 
- PRIMARY: Use reference_prediction as foundation (captures similar historical wind ramps from calm).
- NO exogenous adjustments (corrs=0).
- Data quality flags constant history, but model expects diurnal wind increase → trust model over naive zero-forecast (wind can pick up).
- NO changepoint/trend corrections (all zeros).
- Maintain exact volatility/pattern: gradual ramp-up 0-12h, peak ~12-18h, decline.
- Since power >=0 physically, but model has minor negatives (noise floor), keep as-is (common in normalized/residual models).
- Output exactly 96 points, timestamps from 2024-12-02 00:00:00.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #2)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
[Format Validation Failed] Format validation failed: incorrect number of prediction points (expected 96, got 92)
[LLM Evaluation] <think>
The previous response failed format validation due to only 92 prediction points instead of the required 96. To fix, generate exactly 96 timestamps starting from ""2024-12-20 00:00:00"" at 15-minute intervals, using the base prediction (96 values) with minor exogenous adjustments for humidity/temperature correlations, ensuring valid JSON structure with ""timestamp"" and ""prediction"" keys.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-19 23:45:00"". Next prediction starts at ""2024-12-20 00:00:00"", incrementing by 15 minutes for exactly 96 points (covers 24 hours).

Previous attempt failed due to only 92 points and incorrect format (array of objects instead of flat JSON object). This time, output a flat JSON object with 96 timestamp keys and float values.

Base prediction: Use the 96 values from model_auxiliary_tool.reference_prediction as foundation. They show realistic wind power fluctuations (around 28-39, with peaks near 39), matching historical volatility (median 44.05, mad 27.55, peaks up to 120).

Key refinements from tools:
<tool_think>
- exogenous_analysis: Strong negative correlation with relative_humidity_2m (-0.536), positive with temperature_2m (0.416). No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor adjustment: slightly dampen peaks (by ~0.5-1.0) assuming typical night/morning humidity rise into day, but keep close to base.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints (score 0), high slope_max (40.1) indicates momentum but flatline_ratio 0.9375 suggests periods of stability—preserve base fluctuations rather than smoothing.
- comprehensive_feature_tool/data_quality_tool: Low quality issues (dropout 0, saturation low), high acf1 (0.935) indicates persistence—base model likely captures this. No major corrections needed (e.g., no regime shift, no clipping).
- Overall: Base is reliable; apply tiny exogenous adjustment (-0.2 to -0.8 on peaks for humidity effect) to refine without deviating from pattern/volatility.
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Start with reference values, subtract small humidity penalty (scaled by correlation strength, ~0.3-0.8 varying by position) to incorporate top correlation. Ensures similar volatility (std ~1.8 matching base), no mono-trend.

Verify: 96 points, timestamps correct (e.g., ends at ""2024-12-20 23:45:00""), valid floats, pure JSON object.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #3)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response to review fails format validation because it contains only <think> tags but lacks the required <answer></answer> tags with valid JSON content containing exactly 96 time points. To pass validation, the response must be restructured to include both <think> (with reasoning) and <answer> tags, where <answer> holds a JSON array or object with 96 prediction values starting from timestamp ""2024-12-17 00:00:00"" at 15-minute intervals, using the reference_prediction values from model_auxiliary_tool as the foundation since they meet the exact count and incorporate key patterns (no major adjustments needed per tool analyses: low changepoint score, moderate entropy, and top exogenous correlations already reflected).

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-16 23:45:00"". Next timestamps start at ""2024-12-17 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes for 96 points (exactly 24 hours).

The model_auxiliary_tool provides the reference_prediction with exactly 96 values, which is the PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It must be used as the base, maintaining its patterns, volatility, and fluctuations (gradual decline overall with small variations).

Key tool insights for refinement (no major overrides needed):
- changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0.0 (no regime shift, use full history), flatline_ratio=0.833 but not triggering dead signal (use reference). slope_max=13.9 indicates past momentum but no strong boost needed as reference already captures.
- event_summary_tool: dominant_pattern_name=""rise"" but recent history ends declining (33.9), reference shows continuation of realistic wind pattern (no forced upward trend override).
- exogenous_analysis: wind_speed_80m (0.31 corr) and direct_radiation (0.25 corr) top factors; reference likely incorporates these, no exogenous time series provided for further adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool/data_quality_tool: low quality issues (dropout=0, saturation low), spec_entropy=0.4 (moderate noise, conservative use of reference), median=27.4 aligns with reference values (~23-30 range).
- No significant corrections: low changepoint, no high residuals/drift. Final prediction uses reference_prediction directly as it meets format, count, and incorporates patterns.

Previous attempt failed due to incomplete/invalid JSON structure and wrong format. This uses EXACTLY the required JSON object with 96 timestamp-value pairs, timestamps correctly starting ""2024-12-17 00:00:00"".

1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-21 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-22 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 96 values, around 11-16 range, showing fluctuations and gradual upward trend - MUST preserve this pattern/volatility).

**Exogenous Analysis**:
- Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.935), negative with temperature_2m (-0.447).
- No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor refinement only: slight upward bias expected from base (already increasing).

**Changepoint & Trend** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- flatline_ratio=0.875 high (much flat periods recently, especially end at ~-1), but recent history transitioned from low/negative.
- slope_max=16.5, slope_second_diff_max=21.7 indicate past momentum, but current flat/end low.
- run_length_longest=18 (recent flat segment), sample_entropy low (predictable).
- No dead signal (not fully flat), no truncation/boost/reversion needed. Base already handles transition to ~14.

**Data Quality**:
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.167 (minor clipping risk, historical min ~-1.7, max 97.6), but base starts ~13.7 well within bounds - no clipping.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=26, but recent values much lower (~-1), base appropriately low initially rising.
- acf1=0.968 high autocorrelation - base preserves smoothness.
- flatline_ratio high, but base shows realistic fluctuations (not constant).
- No major corrections needed per _llm_comprehensive_hints.

**Final Decision**: Base prediction optimal - matches wind power transition from calm night to morning winds. Minor smoothing for flatline_ratio (slight dampening of extremes), but preserve fluctuations/volatility. No exogenous future data for adjustment. Output base as-is (round to 1 decimal for consistency with input).

<tool_think>
All tools considered: base as foundation, no strong corrections triggered (low changepoint, moderate quality issues, high flatline but base transitions realistically).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-23 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-24 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases, showing an initial rise, peak around 1.5-1.6, gradual decline to near zero, drop to negative values around -0.7, then recovery back to positive ~0.4 by the end.

Exogenous analysis: Positive correlations with direct_radiation (0.31) and wind_speed_80m (0.23). No specific exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Qualitatively supports wind power generation patterns in reference.

Changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history). slope_max=2.1 (recent uptrend momentum from data end, but reference already incorporates). slope_second_diff_max=1.8 (deceleration possible early in forecast, reference shows peak then decline). flatline_ratio=0.17 (some flat periods historically, but not dominant). No major truncation/boost needed; reference aligns.

Comprehensive_feature_tool: median=-0.9, but recent data shows regime shift to positive (last values 0.5 to 3.2), so no strong bias correction to median. High acf1=0.87 indicates persistence, which reference preserves. spec_entropy=2.65 (some noise), but reference has appropriate fluctuations. cusum_max=29.4 and qkurt=3.75 suggest non-normal tails, but reference volatility matches historical mad~0.1 scaled up.

Data_quality_tool: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.03 minor), no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

Overall: Reference_prediction is optimal base. Recent data ends with sharp rise (22:30 to 23:45: -0.7 to 3.2), reference starts ~1.1-1.2 (reasonable post-peak decay for wind). No significant corrections needed; minor smoothing for wind-like volatility preserved.

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction values directly, rounded to 3 decimals for float consistency with input style, but keep as-is since floats.

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Primary base, no deviation.
- exogenous_analysis: Correlations supportive, no adjustment data.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Hints checked - no bias shift (recent > median), persistence in ref.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoint, momentum in ref.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-24 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-12-25 00:00:00"" through approximately ""2024-12-26 23:45:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They show high generation levels (~100-128) typical for wind power peaks, with fluctuations and slight variations, maintaining realistic volatility.

Key refinements from tools:
<tool_think>
- exogenous_analysis: Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.864), negative with direct_radiation (-0.346). No exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no specific numerical adjustments. Reference_prediction likely already incorporates similar patterns from historical cases.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High flatline_ratio (0.885) and flatline_hits (0.135) indicate periods of low activity historically, but current regime is high-output (no changepoint_score=0). High qkurt (4.58) suggests fat tails/heavy fluctuations—reference_prediction captures this with ~120-128 range variations. Low sample_entropy (0.192) indicates predictable low-complexity signal; stick close to reference.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints (score=0), so no memory truncation. High slope_max (21.4) and slope_second_diff_max (16.9) show momentum bursts historically, but current end is stable high—reference already extrapolates smoothly without over-boosting. High flatline_ratio noted but irrelevant to current high regime. No reversal or mean reversion needed (monotone_duration moderate).
- data_quality_tool: Moderate saturation_ratio (0.135)—clip if needed, but reference values (~120-128) align with historical peak (155.6), no clipping required. No dropouts.
</tool_think>

Overall: No major corrections needed. Reference_prediction is optimal foundation, matching wind power characteristics (high sustained output with fluctuations). Minor smoothing for realism, but preserve volatility/pattern—no monotonic changes.

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction values directly (as floats), assigned to sequential timestamps.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-25 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-26 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes each.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool provides the 96 reference values, which must serve as the primary foundation. These show a generally stable pattern around 60-75 early on, with mild fluctuations and a gradual decline towards the end, maintaining realistic volatility for wind power.

Key refinements from tools:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.75) and negative with relative_humidity_2m (-0.76). No actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no specific directional adjustments possible. Reference already incorporates similar historical cases, so maintain base.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 137.4 (much higher than recent values ~50 and reference ~60-70), suggesting overall level bias but recent regime lower—reference aligns with recent decline. High flatline_ratio (0.9375) and low changepoint_count (0), indicating stable low-output regime with some flat periods. Low spec_entropy (0.476) suggests predictable signal. No major bias correction needed; reference fits recent levels.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score 0), so no memory truncation. slope_max 34 (past uptrend), but current post-peak decline—reference captures continuation without lag. High flatline_ratio reinforces stable low prediction. No momentum boost or reversal needed beyond reference pattern. sample_entropy 0.44 indicates moderate predictability—trust reference fluctuations.

**data_quality_tool**: Low saturation (0.042), quantization (0.104), no dropouts/constants—data reliable, no clipping or uncertainty expansion required.
</tool_think>

Overall: Reference prediction is optimal base, matching recent low regime (ending ~49), diurnal wind patterns (low overnight), and volatility. No significant deviations needed—minor smoothing for wind-like smoothness but preserve fluctuations as instructed. Final prediction uses reference values directly as floats.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-27 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-28 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They show a gradual downward trend from ~82 to ~70, with small fluctuations, which matches wind power behavior at night into morning.

Exogenous analysis: Strong positive correlations with wind_direction_80m (0.735) and wind_speed_80m (0.632). No specific future exogenous values provided, so no direct adjustment, but expect continuation of declining pattern if winds weaken overnight.

Comprehensive features:
- Median 145.4, but recent values are low (~60-80), so prediction in low regime is appropriate.
- High flatline_ratio (0.97) but low flatline_hits (0.02), peak_count=5, indicating structured daily cycle with peaks earlier.
- slope_max=33.4 (past uptrend), slope_second_diff_max=43.2 (acceleration), but changepoint_score=0, no regime shift.
- No truncation or major momentum boost needed; reference already captures continuation.

Changepoint_trend_tool: Confirms no changepoints, moderate slopes, sample_entropy=0.85 (some predictability). No reversal or mean reversion forced; follow reference decline.

Data quality: Low issues (saturation 0.02, no dropouts/constants), no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

Overall: Reference_prediction is optimal base. Minor refinements unnecessary due to lack of exogenous future data and no strong correction signals. Use reference values directly as they match volatility (small fluctuations ~1-3 units) and nighttime wind decline pattern. No injection of trends/peaks as reference shows smooth decay.

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Direct use of reference_prediction (downward trend with fluctuations).
- exogenous_analysis: Correlations noted but no adjustment data.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Low regime confirmed, no bias correction (recent aligns).
- changepoint_trend_tool: No regime shift, follow base momentum.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data, no interventions.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-28 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-29 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes each.

**Base Prediction**: Use model_auxiliary_tool's reference_prediction (96 values) as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Mean ~97.5, shows fluctuations around 95-103, no monotonic trend.

**Exogenous Refinement**:
- Top correlations: wind_direction_80m (-0.806, strong negative), wind_speed_80m (0.512, moderate positive).
- No specific future exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor/no directional adjustment needed. Reference already incorporates typical patterns.

**Changepoint & Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=26.7 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=30: Recent acceleration, but reference already shows mild upward tilt (e.g., later values ~100-102). No strong boost needed.
- flatline_ratio=0.95 high: Indicates many flat periods historically, but reference has fluctuations (std~2-3), so preserve those.
- peak_count=2, monotone_duration low: Expect continued oscillation, matching reference.
- No mean reversion or reversal trigger.

**Data Quality** (data_quality_tool):
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.042 low, quantization=0.115 moderate: Minor clipping risk, but historical max=170+, reference ~100 safe, no clipping.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=55.9 (reference mean higher, but recent history ~100-150, so reference aligns with elevated regime).
- acf1=0.97 high persistence, spec_entropy=0.87 noisy: Reference preserves autocorrelation via smooth fluctuations.
- No major corrections needed per _llm_hints.

**Final Decision**: Reference_prediction is optimal foundation. No significant deviations required. Use it directly (minor rounding to 1 decimal for consistency with input style, but keep as float). Maintains volatility/patterns.

<tool_think>
- Base: reference_prediction used as-is (primary).
- Exog: No future values, correlations noted but no adjustment.
- Changepoint: No shifts, momentum mild.
- Quality: Clean, no clipping/expansion.
- Features: Aligns with recent elevated levels.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #5)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
[Format Validation Failed] Format validation failed: failed to extract <answer></answer> tag content from response
[LLM Evaluation] <think>
The provided response to review contains a <think> tag with detailed reasoning (timestamps, tool analysis, format corrections), but lacks a corresponding <answer> tag with valid JSON containing exactly 96 timestamp-value pairs. This directly causes the ""failed to extract <answer></answer> tag content"" error. Prediction logic appears sound (using reference_prediction[0:96] directly, correct 96-point 15-min increments from 2024-12-15 00:00:00), but format must be fixed for validation.
</think>

<answer>
{{
  ""status"": ""FAILED"",
  ""reason"": ""Missing <answer> tag with valid JSON; response only has <think> without the required 96-point JSON predictions."",
  ""suggestions"": ""Complete the response by adding <answer> tags containing a JSON object with exactly 96 keys in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format (starting '2024-12-15 00:00:00') mapped to reference_prediction[0:96] values as numbers.""
}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-14 23:45:00"". Next timestamps start at ""2024-12-15 00:00:00"" and increment by 15 minutes for 96 points (4 full days).

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool provides exactly 96 values in reference_prediction, which is the PRIMARY FOUNDATION. I will use these directly as they capture optimal forecasting from similar historical cases, including temporal patterns and volatility.

Tool analysis:
<tool_think>
- exogenous_analysis: Strong correlations with wind_speed_80m (0.88) and relative_humidity_2m (-0.86), but no actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no specific adjustments possible.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High flatline_ratio (0.98) but low changepoint_score (0), moderate spec_entropy (0.55), peak_count=3. No major corrections needed (e.g., no regime shift, no dead signal). Median ~106, but reference_prediction mean ~93 aligns reasonably with recent historical decline.
- changepoint_trend_tool: slope_max=40.2 (past uptrend), but changepoint_score=0, so no truncation/boost/reversal needed. flatline_ratio high but not triggering constant output.
- data_quality_tool: Minor saturation (0.03), no dropouts/constants, so no clipping/uncertainty expansion.
Overall: No significant corrections required; reference_prediction is reliable base.
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction[0:96] values directly, mapped to correct timestamps. Ensures exactly 96 points, proper format, and maintains volatility/patterns (e.g., slight fluctuations around 90-95).

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-20 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-12-21 00:00:00"" through approximately ""2024-12-23 23:45:00"".

**Base Prediction**: Use model_auxiliary_tool's reference_prediction (96 values) as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. Mean ~78.5, starts ~72.6, peaks ~83-84 around indices 40-50, then gradual decline to ~66.9. Maintains volatility and fluctuations.

**Exogenous Refinement**: wind_speed_80m (corr 0.727) dominant positive driver, relative_humidity_2m (corr -0.674) negative. No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor adjustment not applied. Reference already incorporates similar cases.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool)**: 
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=27, slope_second_diff_max=25.9 (recent momentum, but reference already captures).
- flatline_ratio=0.979 high but hits=0.042 low (some quantization, not dead signal).
- peak_count=3, no reversal trigger.
- No major truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference handles momentum.

**Event Summary**: dominant_pattern_name=""fall"" (event_dominant_pattern=1.0). Reference shows gradual decline post-peak, aligns perfectly - maintain downward trend constraint.

**Data Quality**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.042 low (minor clipping risk, no bound clipping needed). quality_quantization_score=0.104 minor. No uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features**: median=125.15 (historical daytime high), but recent nighttime ~77 aligns with reference start ~73. acf1=0.94 high persistence (reference smooth). spec_entropy=0.32 moderate noise (follow reference fluctuations). No bias correction needed as reference fits recent levels/pattern.

**Final Strategy**: Reference is optimal - closely follow its pattern/volatility (small fluctuations, peak mid-period, evening decline). No significant deviations. Minor smoothing for wind persistence, but preserves fluctuations. Aligns with ""fall"" constraint and wind-driven volatility.

expert. Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #5)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response to review fails format validation because it lacks properly formatted <answer></answer> tags containing valid JSON with exactly 96 time points. It includes a partial <think> section with tool analysis but no complete JSON prediction output. To pass validation, the response must be restructured to include a complete <think> tag followed by an <answer> tag with JSON array of 96 timestamp-value pairs starting from ""2024-12-12 00:00:00"" at 15-minute intervals, using the model_auxiliary_tool's reference_prediction values closely matched to timestamps.
</think>

<answer>
{{""status"": ""FAILED"", ""reason"": ""Missing <answer> tag with valid JSON containing exactly 96 time points; response is incomplete and lacks prediction JSON.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-11 23:45:00"". The next 96 timestamps start at ""2024-12-12 00:00:00"" and increment by 15 minutes each.

The model_auxiliary_tool provides the reference_prediction with exactly 96 values, which is the PRIMARY FOUNDATION. I will use these values directly as they capture optimal forecasting from similar historical cases, including temporal patterns and volatility.

Exogenous analysis shows strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.84) and wind_direction_80m (0.55). However, no specific exogenous values for the prediction window are provided, so no direct adjustments are applied. The reference_prediction likely already incorporates these dynamics.

Changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift), slope_max=8.3 (recent uptrend captured in reference), flatline_ratio=0.54 (historical flats, but recent peak activity; reference shows continued fluctuations, not constant). No truncation or major boosts needed.

Data quality: Minor saturation (0.07), no dropouts or constants; clip if needed but reference values are reasonable.

Comprehensive features: High flatline_ratio historically, but low changepoint_score, recent momentum (slope_max high); reference maintains realistic volatility.

No significant corrections needed; final prediction closely follows reference_prediction to match patterns, volatility, and avoid smooth mono-trends.

<tool_think>
- Base: Use reference_prediction as-is (96 values).
- Exog: No window data; correlations noted but no adjustment.
- Changepoint: No shifts; momentum in reference OK.
- Quality: Minor issues; no clipping.
- Comp: Historical flats/peaks; reference preserves fluctuations.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #2)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response fails format validation due to incorrect number of prediction points (92 instead of required 96). It also lacks a complete <answer></answer> section with valid JSON containing exactly 96 time points starting from ""2025-01-01 00:00:00"" (corrected from invalid ""2024-31-01""), incrementing by 15 minutes. Thinking process is incomplete (cuts off at ""s...""). To pass, complete the <think> with full reasoning, generate exactly 96 realistic predictions based on the base model (~43-51 range with volatility, recent low trend), and output valid JSON in <answer> with proper timestamps.
</think>

<answer>
{{""PASS"": false, ""issues"": [""Missing complete <answer> JSON with exactly 96 points"", ""Only 92 predictions provided"", ""Invalid start timestamp '2024-31-01'"", ""Incomplete <think>""], ""suggestions"": ""Extend to exactly 96 points starting '2025-01-01 00:00:00'; ensure valid JSON in <answer> with keys 'timestamp' and 'prediction' arrays; complete thinking process.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-30 23:45:00"". The next timestamp is ""2024-12-31 00:00:00"", incrementing by 15 minutes for exactly 96 points (ending at ""2024-12-31 23:45:00"").

The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool provides exactly 96 values (43-51 range, mean ~45.8, std ~1.8), showing realistic volatility and fluctuations typical for wind power. This is the PRIMARY foundation; my prediction will closely follow it without significant deviation to preserve patterns.

Exogenous correlations (under <tool_think>):
- Strongest: wind_speed_80m (0.91) → supports moderate generation levels.
- relative_humidity_2m (-0.79) → no specific forecast values provided, but recent low generation aligns with possible high humidity suppressing output.
No major adjustments needed; reference already incorporates similar cases.

Changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift), slope_max=32.1 (past uptrend, but recent down), flatline_ratio=0.93 high but historical has volatility, so follow reference fluctuations rather than flatten. No truncation/boost/reversion applied.

Data_quality_tool: Minor saturation (0.07), no dropout → clip if needed, but reference within historical bounds (0-191).

Comprehensive_feature_tool: High flatline_ratio but 2 peaks, acf1=0.98 (persistent), spec_entropy=0.74 (some noise) → reference matches with gradual changes and volatility.

No bias correction needed (reference aligns with recent low trend ~26.4 last hist vs reference start 41.8 reasonable ramp-up). Final prediction uses reference_prediction directly as it captures wind-like intermittency.

Verify: 96 points, timestamps correct format/sequence, values floats.
</think>

<tool_think>
Correlations applied: No exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so minor refinement only (slight upward bias from wind_speed corr). Trend tools confirm no major corrections. Quality ok.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #7)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
[Format Validation Failed] Format validation failed: incorrect number of prediction points (expected 96, got 100)
[LLM Evaluation] <think>
Format validation failed due to incorrect number of prediction points (100 instead of 96). Must truncate to exactly 96 points starting from ""2024-12-23 00:00:00"" with 15-minute intervals. Reference_prediction values are reasonable (range -0.35 to -1.98, median ~-1.0, matching wind power volatility), so use first 96 values without modification after truncation.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-22 23:45:00"". Next timestamps start from ""2024-12-23 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes for exactly 96 points.

Previous attempt failed due to incorrect format (array under ""predictions"" instead of timestamp keys) and wrong count (100 instead of 96). Must output JSON object with exactly 96 timestamp keys and float values.

Base prediction: Use model_auxiliary_tool's reference_prediction (100 values provided, but truncate to first 96 as per feedback). This is the primary foundation, capturing volatility and patterns from similar cases (fluctuations around -0.3 to -1.9, median ~-1.0).

Tool analysis:
<tool_think>
- comprehensive_feature_tool: median=-0.9, mad=0.05 (low volatility baseline), acf1=0.87 (high persistence), flatline_ratio=0.145 (some flats but not dominant), peak_count=4 (expect fluctuations). spec_entropy=1.12 (moderately noisy, conservative adjustments).
- changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history), slope_max=1.0/slope_second_diff_max=1.3 (momentum present, but reference already incorporates), flatline_ratio=0.145 (minor, no constant output), monotone_duration=0.33 (no extreme reversion needed).
- exogenous_analysis: direct_radiation corr=0.54 (positive, but no future values provided, no adjustment), relative_humidity_2m corr=-0.31 (minor negative).
- data_quality_tool: All ratios low (saturation=0.02 minor, no clipping/dropout), high reliability.
</tool_think>

No major corrections needed: reference_prediction aligns with historical volatility/range. Minor bias correction: historical median=-0.9, reference median~-1.0, slight shift up by ~0.1 applied sparingly to maintain pattern. No changepoint/quality issues trigger truncation/boost/clip. Preserve fluctuations (no smoothing).

Final prediction: reference_prediction[0:96] with timestamps, minor shift for alignment.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-26 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-27 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes each.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool provides the 96 reference values (~100-106 MW range), which must be the primary foundation. Historical data ends at 121.9, with recent values around 120-170 peaking earlier, now stabilizing ~140 then dropping to 121.9. Reference shows slight decline then stabilization, which aligns with wind power diurnal patterns post-peak.

<tool_think>
Exogenous: Strong positive correlations with wind_speed_80m (0.89) and wind_direction_80m (0.69). No actual future exogenous values provided, so cannot make data-driven adjustments. Assume reference incorporates these via similar cases.

Comprehensive features: High flatline_ratio (0.95) but low flatline_hits (0.04), indicating some stability periods but not dead signal. slope_max=48.2 and slope_second_diff_max=63.6 show momentum earlier, but changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift), so no truncation needed. No need for reversal/boost as recent trend is mild decline. quality_saturation_ratio=0.04 low, no clipping. acf1=0.97 high autocorrelation, spec_entropy=0.85 (some noise), so reference's mild fluctuations are appropriate - no need to flatten or inject more volatility.

No major corrections needed: reference already captures patterns from similar cases.
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches instructions (foundation, similar volatility ~1-5 MW fluctuations, no mono-trend). Round to 1 decimal for consistency with input data.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #4)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response to review contains a <think> tag but lacks a corresponding <answer> tag with valid JSON containing exactly 96 time points, causing the format validation failure. To pass validation, the response must include both <think> and <answer> tags, with <answer> holding a JSON object featuring timestamps starting from ""2024-12-13 00:00:00"" (15-min intervals) and 96 prediction values based on the reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool, ensuring consistent timestamp format.
</think>

<answer>
{{""status"": ""Failed"", ""reason"": ""Missing <answer> tag with valid JSON containing exactly 96 time points; incomplete <think> content suggests unfinished response."", ""suggestion"": ""Complete the response by adding <answer> with JSON array of 96 predictions using reference_prediction values, paired with timestamps from 2024-12-13 00:00:00 at 15-min intervals.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-12 23:45:00"". The next timestamp is ""2024-12-13 00:00:00"", incrementing by 15 minutes for 96 points (exactly 24 hours).

The model_auxiliary_tool provides the reference_prediction with exactly 96 values, which is the PRIMARY FOUNDATION. I will use these directly as they capture optimal forecasting from similar historical cases, including temporal patterns and volatility.

Review of tools for refinements:
<tool_think>
- exogenous_analysis: Strong positive correlations with wind_speed_80m (0.77) and wind_direction_80m (0.54). No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustment applied. Reference_prediction likely already incorporates these dynamics.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Median 39.05 (reference mean ~81.7, higher due to recent high values), high flatline_ratio (0.97) but recent activity shows peaks, spec_entropy 1.42 (some noise), no changepoints. No major bias correction needed as reference aligns with recent regime.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints (score 0), slope_max 39.6 (momentum captured in reference), flatline_ratio high but recent non-flat. No truncation or reversion needed.
- data_quality_tool: Low issues (dropout 0, saturation 0.09), no clipping or uncertainty expansion required.
Overall: Reference_prediction is reliable; minor recent uptick in last historical values (113.9) aligns with reference start (~93). No significant adjustments needed to maintain pattern/volatility.
</tool_think>

Final prediction uses reference_prediction values paired with correct timestamps. JSON validated to have exactly 96 key-value pairs.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #2)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response to review contains a <think> tag with appropriate reasoning (timestamp calculation, base prediction foundation, exogenous factors, changepoint analysis), but lacks <answer> tags with valid JSON containing exactly 96 time points—this caused the format validation failure. To pass validation, the response must include both required tags, with <answer> having a JSON array/object of 96 predictions starting from ""2024-12-30 00:00:00"" in consistent timestamp format (e.g., [{{""timestamp"": ""2024-12-30 00:00:00"", ""prediction"": value}}, ...]).
</think>

<answer>
{{""status"": ""FAILED"", ""reason"": ""Missing <answer> tag with valid JSON containing exactly 96 time points; add JSON like {{\""predictions\"": [{{\""timestamp\"": \""2024-12-30 00:00:00\"", \""value\"": 98.5}}, ...]}} with 96 entries following the base prediction pattern.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-29 23:45:00"". Next timestamps start at ""2024-12-30 00:00:00"" and increment by 15 minutes for 96 points (exactly 4 days).

Base foundation: Use the 96 values from model_auxiliary_tool's reference_prediction as the primary baseline. These capture optimal patterns from similar cases, with gradual decline from ~100 to ~85, maintaining realistic wind power volatility (small fluctuations).

Key refinements:
- exogenous_analysis: Strong negative correlation with wind_direction_80m (-0.53), positive with wind_speed_80m (0.44). No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor adjustment not applied quantitatively; rely on base which likely incorporates this.
- event_summary_tool: dominant_pattern_name ""fall"" (event_dominant_pattern 1.0). Reference_prediction shows consistent downward trend, aligning perfectly—no adjustment needed.
- changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history). High flatline_ratio (0.97) but low flatline_hits (0.05), slope_max=112 indicates past momentum captured in base. No truncation/boost/reversion needed.
- comprehensive_feature_tool & data_quality_tool: High acf1 (0.86) indicates persistence (base follows). Minor saturation (0.05), no clipping/dropouts. Median=131.9 higher than base mean (~96), but recent data trends down, so no major bias shift.
- Overall: Base prediction fits all diagnostics (falling trend, volatility preserved). No significant corrections; use reference values directly to match pattern/volatility requirements.

Final prediction: Assign reference_prediction values sequentially to timestamps.
