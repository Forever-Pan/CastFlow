## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-13 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-11-14 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (96 values provided). Mean ~10.3, shows natural fluctuations around 9-12, with slight variations - this captures temporal patterns/volatility from similar cases. Final prediction MUST closely follow this pattern (no major deviations, maintain fluctuations).

**Exogenous Refinement**: direct_radiation (-0.435) and temperature_2m (-0.395) top negative correlations. No specific future exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor conservative adjustment: slightly dampen peaks if any (but reference already low ~10-13 max, historical median 13.64). No strong adjustment needed.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- flatline_ratio=0.86 high (many flats), flatline_hits=0.04, but peak_count=5, so intermittent activity.
- slope_max=15.3, slope_second_diff_max=21.7 indicate momentum bursts, but monotone_duration low (0.11).
- No dead signal (not fully flat), no truncation/boost/reversion needed. Reference already handles fluctuations post-flats.

**Data Quality**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.04 low (minor clipping risk, no bounds needed), quantization=0.125 ok, no dropout. No uncertainty expansion/clipping.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=13.64 (reference mean ~10.3 lower; minor upward bias correction: +~1-2 to reference values).
- mad=7.35 (historical vol), reference vol similar.
- acf1=0.89 high persistence, spec_entropy=1.24 moderate noise → conservative smoothing minor.
- No event dominance, quality ok.

**Final Strategy**:
- Foundation: reference_prediction.
- Adjustment: Minor bias correction (+1.0 average shift to align median, preserving pattern/vol).
- No exogenous specifics → no directional change.
- Output follows reference fluctuations closely (no mono trends).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-12 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-11-13 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes each.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases.

Key exogenous insights (exogenous_analysis):
- Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.79): Prediction generally increasing aligns with likely sustained/decreasing winds.
- Strong negative correlation with wind_direction_80m (-0.72): No specific forecast values provided, so no directional adjustment needed.
- No exogenous time series data for prediction window provided, so minimal adjustment here.

Comprehensive features (comprehensive_feature_tool, changepoint_trend_tool, data_quality_tool):
- No changepoints (score=0), so no regime truncation.
- High slope_max=16 and slope_second_diff_max=18.6 indicate recent strong upward momentum; reference already incorporates this with gradual increase to ~33 then decline.
- High flatline_ratio=0.875 but in historical low-wind periods (early data); current regime is dynamic peak, so no constant output.
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.094 (minor clipping risk): No strong need to clip.
- High acf1=0.97 indicates persistence; reference preserves this.
- Median=21.34, reference mean ~26 (slightly higher), minor positive bias but acceptable given recent peak at 84.74.
- No major corrections needed; reference is reliable.

Final strategy: Use reference_prediction directly as it aligns with wind power diurnal pattern (night decline after evening peak), exogenous correlations, and diagnostics. No significant deviations required to maintain volatility/patterns.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-11 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-11-12 00:00:00"" through approximately ""2024-11-14 23:45:00"".

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 96 values, ~20-29 range, showing realistic fluctuations around ~26). This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Final prediction must closely follow its pattern/volatility - no major deviations, no flattening or monotonic trends.

**Exogenous Analysis**:
- Top correlations: wind_speed_80m (0.85, strong positive), wind_direction_80m (-0.84, strong negative).
- No specific exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor/no direct adjustment. Reference already likely incorporates similar patterns. Slight upward bias possible if assuming continued wind support, but stick close to base.

**Changepoint/Trend**:
- changepoint_count/score = 0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=20.4 (positive momentum), slope_second_diff_max=35.2 (acceleration), but flatline_ratio=0.95 high (much flat periods recently).
- Recent data: long decline to near-zero/negative, then slight recovery. Reference predicts continuation of low-but-fluctuating regime (~20-28), reasonable mean reversion from lows without over-predicting peaks.

**Data Quality**:
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.115 (minor clipping risk, historical lows near 0/-2, reference ~20+ safe, no clipping needed).
- No dropouts/constants.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- Median=55.79 (higher than reference mean ~26), but recent data much lower; reference appropriately downshifts.
- High flatline_ratio, low sample_entropy (predictable, low volatility) - reference matches with tight fluctuations.
- No need for bias shift/major corrections; reference aligns with recent regime.

**Final Strategy**:
- Adopt reference_prediction directly as it matches instructions: foundation from similar cases, correct volatility/fluctuations.
- No tool-based corrections needed (low changepoint, no exogenous values, quality ok).
- Output exactly 96 timestamp-value pairs in JSON.

<tool_think>
All tools considered: base used as-is (primary), exogenous (no adjustment data), changepoint (no shift/boost), quality (no clipping), comprehensive (hints followed, no bias/injection needed).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-16 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-11-17 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

**Base Prediction**: Use the reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as the PRIMARY foundation (96 values provided). It captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Mean ~35.5, shows fluctuations (no monotonic trend), aligns with wind power characteristics.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.73), negative with relative_humidity_2m (-0.68). No actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Reference already incorporates similar case patterns likely including weather analogs. No major shift needed.

**tool_think** (using comprehensive_feature_tool, changepoint_trend_tool, data_quality_tool):

- **Comprehensive Features**: Median 42.14 (reference mean ~35.5 slightly lower, minor bias but no strong shift needed). High flatline_ratio (0.96) indicates many stable periods, but 3 peaks show volatility. Low changepoint_count/score (0), no regime shift. High acf1 (0.96) confirms persistence, spec_entropy moderate (noisy but predictable). Use reference's fluctuations.

- **Changepoint/Trend**: No changepoints (score 0). slope_max 47.2 (recent uptrend captured in history), but monotone_duration low (0.11), no extreme reversion needed. flatline_ratio high but peak_count 3, so maintain reference's moderate volatility, no constant output.

- **Data Quality**: Low issues (dropout 0, saturation 0.06 minor, no clipping needed).

**Final Strategy**: Adopt reference_prediction directly as it matches instructions (foundation, similar volatility/fluctuations). Minor upward bias correction (+~2-3 based on median diff) not applied as reference fits wind diurnal cycle (night low ~25-30, day rise to ~40). No other corrections override base (no high changepoint, quality clean). Ensures exactly 96 fluctuating points.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-20 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-11-21 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 96 values provided, around 70-80 range, gradual decline with fluctuations). This captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases - MUST follow closely.

**Exogenous Analysis**:
- Top correlations: wind_speed_80m (0.85), wind_direction_80m (0.83) - strong positive.
- No exogenous time series data provided for prediction window, so minor/no direct adjustment. Historical end shows high wind power (101.34), reference predicts decline to ~70s, consistent with possible wind decrease.

**Changepoint & Trend** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift, use full history.
- slope_max=23.3 (recent uptrend), slope_second_diff_max=28.6: Recent acceleration, but reference already incorporates - no strong boost needed.
- flatline_ratio=0.92 high, but recent data active (ending at 101.34), run_length_derivative=10: Not dead signal.
- peak_count=1, monotone_duration low: Single broad peak passed, expect continuation of decline per reference.
- No truncation/boost/reversion applied; reference handles momentum.

**Data Quality**:
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.10: Minor clipping risk, but recent values high (116+), no hard clip needed.
- quality_quantization_score=0.16: Acceptable.
- No uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=27.94 (much lower than recent ~100), but prediction follows recent regime.
- acf1=0.97 high autocorrelation: Reference preserves persistence.
- spec_entropy=1.41 moderate noise: Follow reference fluctuations.
- No major bias correction (reference tuned to similar cases).

**Final Strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it aligns with all diagnostics. Minor smoothing not needed - maintain its volatility/fluctuations. No exogenous series for adjustment. Output as-is for 96 points.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-14 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start at ""2024-11-15 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They show a gradual decline from ~20.8 to ~14-16 range, with fluctuations (e.g., minor dips and rises), maintaining volatility consistent with historical wind power patterns (evening peak decaying overnight).

Exogenous analysis:
- Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.7865): No future values provided, but recent high generation (26.54) suggests sustained decent winds; no downward adjustment needed.
- Strong negative correlation with wind_direction_80m (-0.795): Direction may not favor power; however, without future values, minor conservative adjustment (-0.5 to -1.0 to early values) but preserve overall pattern.

Changepoint_trend_tool:
- No changepoints (score=0), recent strong uptrend momentum (slope_max=7.7, slope_second_diff_max=6.3) from flat to peak.
- flatline_ratio=0.61 high historically, but recent peak overrides; continue gradual decay as in reference.
- peak_count=1, recent peak width ~10 points; reference already models post-peak decline appropriately.

Data quality: Minor saturation (0.083), quantization ok; no clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

Comprehensive features: High ACF (0.92) indicates persistence, low entropy (predictable); median=0 but recent regime shifted up; reference captures this.

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches wind power decay post-peak, incorporates similar cases. Minor exogenous tweak: subtract 0.3 from first 12 points for direction correlation conservatism, then follow reference exactly to preserve fluctuations/volatility. Ensures exactly 96 points, similar pattern (declining with wiggles, not monotone).

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation - use reference as-is for pattern/volatility.
- exogenous_analysis: Minor downward nudge early due to wind_direction corr.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No regime shift; momentum supports reference decay.
- Others: No major corrections (low changepoint, ok quality).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-11-22 23:45:00"". The next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting from ""2024-11-23 00:00:00"" and spanning into November 24.

The primary foundation is the reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool, which provides 96 values starting around 58-60, with fluctuations typical of wind power (high autocorrelation, volatility around recent peak levels ~70-80). This captures patterns from similar historical cases and must be the baseline. No significant deviation; maintain its pattern, volatility, and fluctuations.

Key tool insights for refinement:

<tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool**: Base forecast shows gradual decline initially (58→50s), then stabilization/fluctuations around 50-60, with mild increases later. Matches wind power evening-to-night behavior post-peak. Use directly as foundation.

**exogenous_analysis**: Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.86), negative with direct_radiation (-0.37). No exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so minor/no adjustment needed. Recent historical power high correlates with likely sustained wind; reference already incorporates this implicitly.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median=0 (long flat periods early), but recent regime dominant. High flatline_ratio (0.54) but irrelevant now (post-peak active). High cusum_max/slope_max (12.2) indicates strong recent uptrend momentum captured in reference. Low changepoint_count=0 (no structural break). Low sample_entropy (predictable). Use hints: level/scale ok (recent volatility matches ref), no regime shift.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0), high slope_max=12.2 (past uptrend, but reference shows post-peak stabilization - no boost needed). slope_second_diff_max=9.1 (past acceleration), monotone_duration short (0.24), high flatline_ratio historical but not current. No reversal/mean reversion trigger; follow reference momentum decay.

**data_quality_tool**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.385 (moderate clipping risk from flats/peaks), so clip predictions conservatively to historical bounds (~0-80). Reference values (50-60) are safely within bounds - no clipping needed. No dropouts.

Overall: No major corrections. Reference already handles regime (post-peak), momentum decay, quality. Minor smoothness to ensure wind-like fluctuations preserved.
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction values directly (as floats), paired with correct timestamps. Ensures exactly 96 points, matching volatility/pattern.

**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-23 23:45:00"". Next timestamps start from ""2024-11-24 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes for 96 points (covers exactly 24 hours into Nov 24).

**Base Prediction**: Use the 96 values from model_auxiliary_tool.reference_prediction as the foundation. They show realistic wind power fluctuations around 8-13 MW, consistent with wind patterns (low overnight, some morning rise, daily variations). Historical data ended with long flatline at 0 from 16:45 onwards, but base prediction correctly anticipates recovery.

**Tool Analysis**:
<tool_think>
**exogenous_analysis**: Strong negative correlation with relative_humidity_2m (-0.62), positive with direct_radiation (0.33). No exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so minor refinement: base already low (historical night low), slight upward bias expected as radiation may increase towards morning, humidity effects dampen extremes. No major adjustment needed.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: High flatline_ratio (0.72), flatline_hits (0.30), quality_saturation_ratio (0.30), quality_quantization (0.29) indicate data quality issues (likely clipping at 0 during shutdown). Median 46.19, but recent regime is low. Predictability low (high spec_entropy), so conservative smoothing around base. No changepoints (score 0), but high slope_max (66.7) earlier suggests momentum captured in base.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: flatline_ratio high (0.72), but base already transitions out of flatline appropriately (starts ~8-10). No regime shift (changepoint 0), monotone_duration moderate (0.31). Use base pattern, no truncation/boost needed. High run_length_derivative (11) confirms recent flat, but predict continuation of base recovery.

**data_quality_tool**: saturation_ratio 0.30 → clip predictions to historical bounds (0-133), but base values (7-13) well within, no clipping required. No dropouts.
</tool_think>

**Final Strategy**: Base prediction is optimal foundation from similar cases. Minor refinements: 
- No exogenous series, so no directional shift.
- Quality issues → stay conservative, no amplification.
- Maintain base volatility/fluctuations (small waves 7-13 range).
- No trend extrapolation; follow base pattern exactly as it matches wind diurnal cycle post-flatline.

Output exactly 96 points using base values (floats), generate sequential timestamps.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-21 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-22 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes, spanning into 2024-11-22.

**Base from model_auxiliary_tool**: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They capture patterns from similar cases, showing gradual increase from ~1-6 early, stabilizing around 3-8 mid, then rising to 6-11 later with fluctuations.

**Exogenous adjustments (exogenous_analysis)**:
- Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.80): No future values provided, so minor boost assumed for overall upward trend in reference.
- Negative with wind_direction_80m (-0.57): No future values, no adjustment.
- No tool provides future exogenous series, so keep adjustments minimal.

**Changepoint & trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool)**:
- changepoint_score=0, no regime shift, use full history.
- High flatline_ratio=0.90 (much of history near-zero/flat late), but reference_prediction already low-starting and rising appropriately.
- slope_max=24.4 (early rise), slope_second_diff_max=20.5 (acceleration), supports reference's initial low and build-up.
- No need for truncation/boost/reversion; reference aligns.
- peak_count=2, sample_entropy low=0.22 (predictable), flatline_hits low.

**Quality (data_quality_tool)**:
- saturation_ratio=0.10 low, no clipping.
- quantization=0.21 moderate, no major issues.
- No uncertainty expansion needed.

**Comprehensive stats**:
- Median=33.69, but recent data near 0; reference starts low ~1-5, rises to ~10, reasonable for wind power continuation.
- acf1=0.96 high persistence, but late flat; reference has fluctuations matching volatility.
- No bias correction needed as reference from similar cases.

**Final strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches instructions (foundation, patterns, volatility). Minor smoothing not needed; output as-is for exact 96 floats. Timestamps generated correctly (e.g., 2024-11-22 00:00:00 to ~2024-11-23 17:45:00).
<tool_think>
All tools considered: base dominant, exogenous no future data for adjustment, features confirm no major corrections (low changepoint/entropy, high flatline but reference handles).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-27 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-11-28 00:00:00"" through approximately ""2024-11-30 23:45:00"".

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the PRIMARY foundation. They show a gradual downward trend from ~135-137 to ~124 with small fluctuations, capturing typical wind power volatility and diurnal patterns from similar cases. Mean ~130.8, std ~2.8, matching expected scale (historical median 162.69 but recent values ~138-140 transitioning lower).

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlations with wind_speed_80m (0.54) and wind_direction_80m (0.46). No specific future exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Qualitatively supports gradual decline if winds weaken (consistent with base prediction).

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shift; use full history.
- slope_max=37.9 (uptrend momentum earlier), slope_second_diff_max=50.4: Past acceleration, but current flatline_ratio=0.958 (high stability), peak_count=4.
- monotone_duration=0.094 (short), sample_entropy=0.73 (moderate predictability).
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; base prediction already handles momentum lag with smooth decline.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** All ratios low (dropout=0, saturation=0.03, constant=0). High reliability; no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features:** flatline_ratio high indicates stable signal; acf1=0.89 shows persistence (base pred preserves). spec_entropy=0.14 (low noise). No major corrections; median=162.69 higher than recent (~140) and pred mean, but base from similar cases accounts for diurnal decline.

**Final Decision:** No significant deviations needed. Use reference_prediction directly as it matches volatility (small flucts ~2-3 units), scale, and expected wind decline. Minor smoothing not required as pattern is realistic for wind power (no mono trend).

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-26 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-11-27 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They show a gradual downward trend from ~149 to ~125 with natural fluctuations, maintaining realistic volatility for wind power (no monotonic change).

Exogenous analysis: Strong positive correlations with wind_speed_80m (0.59) and wind_direction_80m (0.50). No specific future exogenous values provided, so no quantitative adjustment. Qualitatively, recent historical high generation (180-190s in evening) suggests sustained decent wind, aligning with reference starting at 149 (reasonable decay from 163).

Comprehensive features:
- High flatline_ratio (0.92) but recent data shows peaks (e.g., 17:00-21:00 sustained ~180-190), so not ""dead signal"".
- slope_max=97.3, slope_second_diff_max=72.9 indicate prior momentum, but changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift), so continue base trend decay.
- No quality issues requiring clipping/expansion (low dropout/saturation).
- Median=118.59; reference mean ~130 (slightly higher, minor positive bias OK given recent highs).

Changepoint_trend: No truncation/boost needed (changepoint=0, flatline high but recent dynamic). Predict continuation of mild decline with fluctuations matching reference.

Data quality: Minor saturation (0.05), quantization (0.17) - no major correction.

Final: Use reference_prediction directly as it captures patterns from similar cases, volatility, and wind-like fluctuations. No significant deviations needed.
<tool_think>
- Incorporated exogenous correlations qualitatively (sustained wind implied).
- No changepoint/memory truncation.
- Reference maintains volatility (MAD~51 historical).

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #3)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response to review contains <think> tags but lacks <answer> tags with valid JSON containing exactly 96 time points, causing the format validation failure. To pass validation, the response must include properly formatted <answer> JSON with timestamps starting from ""2024-11-16 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes to ""2024-11-18 23:45:00"" (exactly 96 points) using the 96 reference_prediction values from the tool as the primary foundation, without modification, extension, or trimming. Prediction values appear reasonable based on tool analysis (captures momentum, no major data quality issues), but format must be corrected first.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-11-15 23:45:00"". The next 96 timestamps start at ""2024-11-16 00:00:00"" and increment by 15 minutes, ending at ""2024-11-18 23:45:00"" (exactly 96 points: 4 full days).

The model_auxiliary_tool provides exactly 96 reference_prediction values, which must serve as the PRIMARY FOUNDATION. These values capture temporal patterns, volatility, and momentum from similar historical cases. I will use them directly without modification, extension, or trimming, as per feedback.

Tool analysis:
<tool_think>
- **exogenous_analysis**: Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.56) and wind_direction_80m (0.34). No exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no direct adjustments possible. Reference_prediction likely already incorporates these via similar cases.
- **comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0), high flatline_ratio (0.97) but low hits (0.02), moderate peaks (6), high slope_max (36.2) indicating momentum captured in reference. sample_entropy (1.36) suggests moderate predictability/noise – reference handles this. No truncation/boost/reversion needed.
- **data_quality_tool**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.02, quantization=0.14) – no clipping/uncertainty expansion required.
- Overall: Reference_prediction is reliable; no major corrections needed. Maintains realistic wind power fluctuations (30-37 range, matching historical median ~39).
</tool_think>

Previous attempt failed due to incorrect format (array with ""predictions"" wrapper, incomplete). Fix: Direct JSON object with timestamp keys and float values, exactly 96 entries, valid JSON.

No deviations from reference values needed – they show appropriate volatility (std ~1.5, range 27-37), not monotonic.
</think>

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #2)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response fails format validation because it lacks proper <answer></answer> tags containing valid JSON with exactly 96 time points. To pass validation, the response must be restructured to include complete <think> reasoning followed by <answer> with a JSON object matching input timestamp format (e.g., {{""2024-11-18 00:00:00"": value, ...}} for 96 sequential 15-min increments from ""2024-11-18 00:00:00"" to ""2024-11-20 23:45:00""), using the referenced 96 prediction values as the basis with any tool-based refinements applied quantitatively.
</think>

<answer>
{{""PASS"": false, ""modification"": ""Restructure response with complete <answer></answer> tags containing valid JSON of exactly 96 timestamped prediction values; complete the truncated thinking and base predictions on the 96 reference values with explicit exogenous adjustments.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Input Data

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.

First, identify the starting timestamp for predictions: the historical data ends at ""2024-11-17 23:45:00"". The next timestamp is ""2024-11-18 00:00:00"", incrementing by 15 minutes for exactly 96 points (covering 4 full days: Nov 18 to Nov 21 23:45:00).

Base prediction: Use the 96 values from model_auxiliary_tool's ""reference_prediction"" as the PRIMARY FOUNDATION. These capture optimal patterns from similar historical cases, including fluctuations (e.g., low around 0-3 early, rising to 4+ midday, varying daily).

Tool analysis for refinements (<tool_think>):

**exogenous_analysis**: Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.72) and direct_radiation (0.45). Historical data shows wind-driven peaks midday (12-15h). Reference already embeds similar patterns, so minor uplift (~5-10% scaling on peak hours 12-15h each day) to emphasize wind/radiation influence without altering fluctuation structure.

**comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool**: High flatline_ratio (0.79) and flatline_hits (0.09) indicate periods of low/no generation (common in wind at night/calm), low changepoint_count/score (0) means no regime shift—extrapolate smoothly. High slope_max (11) and slope_second_diff_max (12.3) suggest momentum in peaks; boost peak values slightly (+0.5 to 1.0) for uptrend compensation. Low sample_entropy (0.165) indicates predictable low-volatility signal post-flatline. Median 7.59, but recent history low/negative—reference starts low, aligns.

**data_quality_tool**: Minor saturation_ratio (0.09)—clip any extreme predictions to historical bounds (min -1.8, max 50.74), but reference is well within (0 to ~4.8).

No major corrections needed (no high changepoints, dropouts, or residuals). Final prediction: reference values with subtle scaling (1.05x on indices ~40-60 per day for wind peaks) to incorporate exogenous and momentum, preserving exact fluctuation pattern/volatility (e.g., daily lows ~0-1, peaks ~3-4+).

Verify: Exactly 96 floats, timestamps correct format/spacing, JSON valid.

<tool_think>
Exogenous: Scale peaks 1.05x for wind_speed_80m correlation. Changepoint: No truncation. Trend: Minor boost on slopes. Quality: No clipping needed. Pattern preserved.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-29 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-11-30 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes each.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They capture patterns from similar historical cases, showing mild fluctuations around ~50-58 initially, gradually declining towards the end to ~45-49.

Exogenous analysis: Strong positive correlations with wind_speed_80m (0.92) and wind_direction_80m (0.76). Historical data shows power declining from ~170s overnight to lows around 20-40 in evening, consistent with weakening wind. Reference prediction continues this gradual decline logically. No exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no specific numerical adjustments; maintain base trend.

Comprehensive features: High flatline_ratio (0.99) indicates mostly stable periods with few changes, low changepoint_score (0), low sample_entropy (0.34) suggests predictable low-volatility signal. Median 110.74 but recent values much lower (~20-40), so reference aligns with recent regime. No major corrections needed (no changepoints, no extreme monotone_duration).

Changepoint_trend: No regime shifts (changepoint_count=0), moderate slope_max (30) but in context of decline already captured. High flatline_ratio supports stable, non-volatile prediction matching reference fluctuations.

Data quality: Minor saturation (0.03), quantization (0.19), no dropouts/constants – data reliable, no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

Overall: Reference prediction is optimal base. No strong reasons for deviation – slight decline with small fluctuations fits wind power behavior post-low evening winds, high correlations, and diagnostics. Use reference values directly as final prediction (minor rounding for float consistency).

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation – use reference_prediction directly.
- exogenous_analysis: Confirms wind-driven decline; no adjustment data.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Low entropy, high flatline → stable prediction OK.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No shifts, supports continuation.
- data_quality_tool: Reliable data.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
The historical data shows 96 points of exactly 0.0 power generation, indicating no wind activity (flatline). Key tool insights:

<tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool**: Provides reference_prediction with 96 values showing realistic wind patterns: starts near-zero/negative (calm), ramps up to peak ~0.44 around midday (strong wind), then declines to negative by evening. This is the PRIMARY foundation - must follow its pattern, volatility, and fluctuations closely.

**exogenous_analysis**: All correlations 0.0, no adjustment needed from weather variables.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: median=0, mad=0, flatline_ratio=0.01, quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, monotone_duration~0.99, sample_entropy=0. Confirms dead/constant signal. Hints: check data quality (high constant ratio suggests invalid/reliability issue), predictability low (spec_entropy=0).

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0), slope_max=0, high monotone_duration/flatline - hints at mean reversion or dead signal (output constant).

**data_quality_tool**: quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0 (fully constant), saturation_ratio=1.0 - CRITICAL warning: clip to historical bounds (0.0), mark invalid channel.

Conflicting signals: reference_prediction shows dynamic wind pattern (appropriate for wind power), but quality tools flag constant zero as invalid/dead signal.
</tool_think>

Resolution as time series forecasting expert: Historical all-zero likely indicates turbine off, no wind, or data issue, but wind power forecasts must anticipate potential wind onset using similar cases (reference_prediction). Quality flags suggest clipping unrealistic negatives/peaks to >=0 (power can't be negative), but reference includes small negatives (normalization?). Prioritize reference as foundation (instructions: ""MUST be used"", ""closely follow pattern/volatility""). No exogenous signal to adjust. No changepoints/trends to correct. For quality constant signal, slight damping toward 0 but retain fluctuations (don't flatten entirely, as wind can start suddenly). Final: use reference directly (already realistic), ensure non-negative by max(0, ref) for physical realism, but since small negatives are minor and reference is from similar cases, keep as-is to match volatility.

Last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-01 23:45:00"". Next 96: start ""2024-12-02 00:00:00"", increment 15min (covers ~1.5 days into Dec 3).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
The historical data shows a long flatline at 0.0 from 00:00 to 19:15, followed by minor negative values, then a sharp ramp-up starting around 21:00 peaking near 22:30-22:45, and a gradual decline by 23:45. This indicates a wind event activating late evening.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** The reference_prediction provides 96 values starting from ~26.8 and showing realistic wind power dynamics: initial slight decline, stabilization around 23-27, mid-period dip to ~20s, later recovery to ~26. This captures typical diurnal wind patterns with fluctuations, volatility matching historical ramp-up/decline. This is the PRIMARY foundation - final prediction must closely follow its pattern, levels, and volatility.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Key correlations: temperature_2m (-0.55, strong negative - lower temp → higher power), wind_direction_80m (0.38, positive). No specific future exogenous values provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment not applied. Base already incorporates similar case patterns.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):** 
- changepoint_score=0 (no structural breaks detected).
- slope_max=15.9 (strong recent uptrend momentum from ramp-up), slope_second_diff_max=11 (initial acceleration).
- monotone_duration=0.79 (recent uptrend not extreme, no mean reversion needed).
- flatline_ratio=0.1875 (early flatline, but recent active - no dead signal).
- peak_count=1, low sample_entropy=0.024 (clear single peak event).
Action: Recent momentum suggests base prediction's continuation of decline/stabilization is appropriate; slight boost early if needed, but base already aligns. No truncation or reversal forced.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** High quality_quantization_score=0.875, low saturation=0.03125, no dropouts/constants. No clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Overall Strategy:** Use reference_prediction as-is - it matches historical recent decline post-peak, incorporates similar case volatility/fluctuations (no mono-trend), and aligns with wind regime (post-ramp stabilization with diurnal cycle). No major corrections: tools confirm data reliability, recent momentum continuation without regime shift. Minor smoothing not needed as fluctuations are realistic for wind.

Last historical timestamp: ""2024-11-25 23:45:00"". Next 96 points increment by 15min, wrapping to 2024-11-26.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
Historical data analysis: The entire 96-point history is flat at 0.0, indicating no wind generation (likely calm conditions). Features confirm this: median=0, mad=0, flatline_ratio>0, quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, changepoint_score=0, monotone_duration near 1, sample_entropy=0.

Tool insights:
- <tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool**: Provides reference_prediction as foundation. It starts low positive (~0.3 decreasing to negative), goes deeply negative (down to -0.34), with fluctuations. This captures similar historical wind patterns post-flat periods. Must follow its pattern/volatility closely.
**exogenous_analysis**: All correlations=0.0, no adjustment needed.
**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Confirms flat/constant signal (quality_*=1.0, flatline_hits=1.0, event_dominant_pattern=2.0 likely 'flat'). Hints: check data quality (constant → consider reversion, but use base forecast). No regime shift (changepoint=0).
**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints, high monotone_duration → consider mean reversion, but flatline_ratio low (0.01), so not ""dead signal"". Follow base.
**data_quality_tool**: High constant/saturation → clip to historical bounds? History max=0, but wind can rise; reference starts positive small, so use as-is (no hard clip to 0).
</tool_think>

Prediction strategy: Use reference_prediction directly as foundation (per instructions). No exogenous adjustments. Data quality/flat history suggests caution, but model selected similar cases expecting ramp-up then decline (typical wind). No strong corrections (no changepoints, no high residuals). Minor clip negatives to 0.0 for physical realism (wind power >=0), but keep small positives/fluctuations to match volatility. However, instructions prioritize reference pattern, so use raw values (negatives possible as normalized/residual signals).

Final: Directly adopt reference_prediction (96 values) for timestamps starting ""2024-12-03 00:00:00"".

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp from input: ""2024-11-28 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-11-29 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the provided reference_prediction (96 values) as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows a gradual downward trend from ~150 to ~113 with small fluctuations, capturing typical wind power volatility and patterns from similar cases. Prediction must closely follow this pattern/volatility – no major deviations, no forcing monotonicity.

**Exogenous Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** 
- Top correlations: wind_direction_80m (-0.42, inverse), relative_humidity_2m (+0.41, direct).
- No actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so cannot apply specific value-based adjustments. Note general inverse wind direction effect but no quantitative shift applied (conservative, as base already incorporates similar cases).

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift, use full history.
- flatline_ratio high (0.92): Indicates periods of low variability in history (e.g., midday zero), but recent history (evening) active ~170s. Base prediction appropriately decays without flatlining – no need for constant output.
- slope_max (123) and slope_second_diff_max (121) high: Suggests past momentum, but current post-peak decay; base already models gradual decline (momentum continuation).
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; base aligns.

**Quality (data_quality_tool):** 
- saturation_ratio 0.083 (low), no clipping.
- quantization 0.135 (minor), dropout 0: Reliable data, no uncertainty expansion.

**Stats (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median 135.14: Base starts ~151 (recent-aligned), decays to ~113 – reasonable given evening peak decay.
- mad 28.85: Base volatility matches historical fluctuations.
- acf1 0.92 (persistent), sample_entropy 0.49 (moderate predictability): Base preserves autocorrelation via smooth decline.
- No bias correction (mean/residual near 0), no injection needed.

**Final Strategy:** Adopt reference_prediction directly as it incorporates optimal models from similar cases, aligns with all diagnostics (no major corrections triggered). Minor rounding to 2 decimals for consistency with input style, but keep as floats. Maintains required fluctuations/volatility.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
The historical data shows 96 points of exactly 0.0 power generation, indicating no wind activity over the full day (2024-12-03 00:00 to 23:45). This is a flatline scenario, confirmed by comprehensive_feature_tool (flatline_ratio=0.0104 but flatline_hits=1.0, monotone_duration=0.99, sample_entropy=0.0, all dynamic features=0) and data_quality_tool (quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, indicating constant signal). Changepoint_trend_tool reinforces no regime shifts, trends, or peaks (all 0).

The model_auxiliary_tool provides a reference_prediction with small fluctuations around zero (starting positive ~0.2-0.3, then mostly negative values -0.01 to -0.34). However, for wind power, negative generation is physically impossible (power >=0). Given the perfect flatline history and constant channel quality flag, the data likely represents a ""dead signal"" or no-wind regime persisting.

Per tool hints:
- changepoint_trend_tool: flatline_ratio notable with hits=1 → output constant.
- data_quality_tool: constant_channel_ratio=1.0 → treat as invalid for dynamic prediction, default to constant.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: dominant_pattern=2.0 (likely 'flat'), quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0 → keep flat.

Exogenous correlations all 0.0, no adjustment signals.

Although instructions emphasize using reference_prediction as foundation and maintaining its fluctuations, the overwhelming evidence of constant zero history and quality flags takes precedence for physical realism in wind power forecasting. Persisting the flat zero regime is the most appropriate: predict 0.0 for all 96 future points (2024-12-04 00:00:00 to 2024-12-04 23:45:00).

Last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-03 23:45:00"". Next 96: increment by 15min, rolling to 2024-12-04.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #7)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The previous response failed format validation due to providing only 1 prediction point instead of the required 96. To pass, the response must include exactly 96 time points starting from ""2024-11-20 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes, using the reference_prediction pattern (initial ~23-25 fluctuating, gradual decline to ~10 with volatility preserved) as the base, since no exogenous future data is available and changepoint analysis supports continuity without regime shift.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
The historical data ends at ""2024-11-19 23:45:00"", so predictions start at ""2024-11-20 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes for exactly 96 points (4 full days). The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool provides the primary foundation with initial values ~23-25 fluctuating, then gradual decline to ~10 with preserved volatility, matching the required pattern and covering exactly 96 points. No exogenous future data is provided, so no adjustments from exogenous_analysis. Changepoint tools show changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift), flatline_ratio high but historical shows volatility, slope_max positive earlier supports continuity. Data quality is acceptable (low dropout/saturation). Comprehensive features confirm no major corrections needed (e.g., median~57 historical vs. low recent values justifies decline continuation). Final prediction uses reference_prediction values directly as floats, maintaining all fluctuations.

<tool_think>
Reference_prediction used as-is: starts ~22-25 fluctuating (first 24 points avg~23.7), declines gradually to ~10 by end with volatility (e.g., small ups/downs preserved). Matches feedback pattern. No changepoint truncation needed. No quality clipping. Exogenous correlations noted but no future values for adjustment.

expert. Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #5)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response to review fails format validation because it lacks properly closed <think> tags and has no <answer></answer> tags containing valid JSON with exactly 96 time points. To pass validation, complete the <think> section briefly, then add a properly formatted <answer> with JSON array of 96 prediction values starting from ""2024-11-19 00:00:00"" at 15-minute intervals, using the reference_prediction values (70-82 MW range) as the base while preserving their patterns.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
Last historical timestamp is ""2024-11-18 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start at ""2024-11-19 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes (covers exactly 24 hours). Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as primary foundation (exactly 96 values, 70-82 MW range with fluctuations). Historical data shows wind power peaking daytime, dipping overnight, ending at 101.04 MW; reference continues gradual decline then stabilization with volatility. Exogenous: strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.93) and wind_direction_80m (0.87), so maintain reference patterns assuming continued favorable winds. Features: high flatline_ratio early in history but recent dynamic; no changepoints; quality_saturation_ratio 0.21 suggests minor clipping risk but no adjustment needed. No major corrections: use reference_prediction directly as it captures patterns. Previous attempt invalid (wrong format, incomplete). Output strict JSON object with 96 timestamp:float pairs.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
The historical data shows 96 points of exactly 0.0 power generation, spanning from ""2024-12-05 00:00:00"" to ""2024-12-05 23:45:00"". This indicates a complete flatline (monotone_duration ~0.99, flatline_ratio ~0.01, quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0). No wind activity over the full day.

Tool analysis:
- <tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool**: Provides reference_prediction with 96 values starting positive (~0.27) then declining to negative (~-0.18). This captures expected wind patterns from similar cases but conflicts with the flat historical signal.
**exogenous_analysis**: All correlations 0.0 (no weather data influence).
**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Confirms flatline (flatline_hits=1.0, sample_entropy=0.0, peak_count=0.0), quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, event_dominant_pattern=2.0 (likely 'flat').
**changepoint_trend_tool**: monotone_duration=0.9896 (extremely long), flatline_ratio=0.0104, no changepoints/trends/slopes/peaks (all 0.0). Hints: ""If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as invalid or output constant""; ""If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider mean reversion"".
**data_quality_tool**: quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, quality_saturation_ratio=1.0. Hints: ""If quality_constant_channel_ratio is high, mark related channels as invalid""; saturation implies clip to historical bounds (0.0).
</tool_think>

Forecast reasoning as time series expert:
- Primary foundation is reference_prediction, but data quality and trend tools override due to dead/flat signal detection (constant_channel_ratio=1.0, flatline confirmation).
- Wind power cannot be negative; clip negatives to 0.0. Historical max=0.0 sets upper bound.
- No evidence of regime shift (changepoint_score=0.0); extreme monotone flatness mandates mean reversion to historical mean/median=0.0.
- No volatility (mad=0.0, acf=0.0), no predictability signals. Conservative strategy: predict continuation of flatline (constant 0.0), ignoring reference_prediction's unrealistic negatives/positives given perfect historical zero.
- Next timestamps start ""2024-12-06 00:00:00"" incrementing 15min for 96 points (exactly 4 days).

Final prediction: All 0.0 to respect data quality gate, flatline diagnosis, and physical bounds.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
Historical data analysis: The entire 96-point historical series is completely flat at 0.0, indicating no wind generation over a full 24-hour period. This is confirmed by comprehensive_feature_tool showing median=0, mad=0, acf1=0, flatline_ratio=0.01 (near-flat), monotone_duration=0.99, sample_entropy=0, quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, and data_quality_tool confirming high constant channel ratio.

Tool insights:
- <tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool**: Provides reference_prediction with 96 values starting negative (~-0.1 to -0.25), transitioning to positive peak (~0.39 around index 48), then declining back to negative (~-0.25). This captures expected wind power diurnal pattern (low night, peak midday/afternoon, decline evening/night). Since historical is zero but tool selected from similar cases, this is the foundation forecast.
**exogenous_analysis**: All correlations=0.0 (no weather data influence), so no adjustments needed.
**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Confirms flat/constant signal (quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, flatline_hits=1.0, event_dominant_pattern=2.0 likely 'flat'). Hints: check data quality/reliability; high constant ratio suggests invalid/low-reliability signal.
**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0), no slope/peaks, high monotone_duration → consider mean reversion (to 0). flatline_ratio high → output constant or mark invalid. But hints prioritize regime (none here).
**data_quality_tool**: quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0 → mark channel as invalid; quality_saturation_ratio=1.0 → clip to historical bounds (0.0).
</tool_think>

Prediction strategy: Reference_prediction is PRIMARY foundation and MUST be closely followed for pattern/volatility (fluctuations from neg→pos peak→neg). However, data_quality_tool is MOST IMPORTANT warning: high constant_channel_ratio=1.0 mandates marking invalid + clipping to historical bounds (0.0). Flat signal + zero history suggests no generation expected (e.g., no wind, turbines off). To resolve: since wind power cannot be negative, apply quality clipping by taking max(0, reference_prediction) for each point. This preserves pattern/volatility (rises to ~0.39 peak, declines) while respecting bounds/quality gate. No exogenous adjustments (corr=0). No changepoint/momentum corrections needed (all 0). Final prediction maintains reference fluctuations but clipped >=0.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-07 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-12-08 00:00:00"" through approximately ""2024-12-10 23:45:00"".

**Base Prediction**: Use model_auxiliary_tool's reference_prediction (96 values) as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It shows values around 7-12 MW with fluctuations, capturing similar historical patterns and volatility. Final prediction must closely follow this pattern/volatility.

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong correlations: relative_humidity_2m (-0.907), temperature_2m (0.814). No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor adjustment not applied. Base remains dominant.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis** (from changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- flatline_ratio=0.73 (high early flatline, but recent active).
- slope_max=11.3, slope_second_diff_max=13.2 (recent momentum, but no ongoing acceleration needing boost/reversal).
- peak_count=1, monotone_duration low → no mean reversion or dead signal. No major corrections; reference_prediction already handles.

**Data Quality** (data_quality_tool): Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.02, quantization=0.29). No clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

**Cross-channel**: corr_flip_count=4 (some instability, reduce weight), lead_lag_shift_mean=31.7 (not actionable without aux data). No adjustment.

**Comprehensive Features**: High acf1=0.976 (persistent), spec_entropy=1.27 (some noise → conservative), flatline_ratio high but recent dynamic. Median=12.45 close to ref mean (~10). No bias shift. Reference_prediction aligns well.

**Decision**: Use reference_prediction directly as it incorporates similar cases, maintains required fluctuations/volatility. No significant deviations needed per tools.

<tool_think>
- Base: reference_prediction → foundation (fluctuating 7-12 MW).
- Exog: Strong RH/temp corr, no future data → no change.
- Changepoint: score=0, no truncation/boost.
- Quality: Clean → no clipping.
- Cross: Unstable corr → ignore.

**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-11 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-12 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases.

Key refinements:
- exogenous_analysis: Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.84) and wind_direction_80m (0.55). Recent data shows a strong evening peak (up to 30.4) driven by wind, now declining. Reference prediction starts around 6-8 and fluctuates mildly, consistent with post-peak wind decay. No exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment: slightly dampen initial values downward from recent trend (5.1) but follow reference upward pattern.
- event_summary_tool: dominant_pattern_name ""rise"" (event_dominant_pattern 0.0, rise=4 segments). Maintain upward trend constraint, which aligns with reference starting at ~6.9 rising to ~8-9 mid-window.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints (score=0), high flatline_ratio (0.54) but recent peak overrides; slope_max=8.3 and slope_second_diff_max=10.4 indicate recent momentum, but post-peak so no boost needed. peak_count=1 aligns with single evening peak.
- data_quality_tool: Minor saturation (0.07), no major issues; no clipping needed.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High acf1 (0.96) indicates persistence (good for reference model); flatline_ratio high but recent volatility; median=0 but recent mean ~10, so use recent context.

Overall: Reference prediction shows realistic wind post-peak pattern: initial mild rise, fluctuations, secondary peaks around 8-9, gradual decline. Matches wind correlations and rise dominance. Minor adjustment: reduce first few points slightly (6.87->5.5, etc.) to bridge from last historical 5.1, then follow reference closely to preserve volatility/patterns. No major deviations.

Final prediction uses reference with small initial decay adjustment then tracks reference.

<tool_think>
Used all tools:
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation (reference_prediction).
- exogenous_analysis: Wind-driven, post-peak decay then fluctuations.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Persistence high, use reference.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No regime shift, momentum post-peak.
- data_quality_tool: Minor saturation, ok.
- event_summary_tool: ""rise"" constraint satisfied by reference.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-08 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-09 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes (into Dec 9 and beyond).

**Base Foundation (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the 96 reference_prediction values as primary baseline. They show gradual decline from ~11.4 to ~11.2 with fluctuations (e.g., dips to ~8.6, rises to ~12.1), maintaining realistic wind power volatility/patterns. Final prediction must closely follow this pattern/volatility.

**Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** 
- Strongest correlations: relative_humidity_2m (+0.57, inverse to power), direct_radiation (-0.37, inverse).
- No specific exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so minor/no direct adjustment. Reference already incorporates similar cases.

**Changepoint/Trend (changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift, use full history).
- slope_max=5.0, slope_second_diff_max=5.7 (past momentum, but recent data ends in uptrend to 12.3; reference smoothly continues without extreme boost).
- flatline_ratio=0.55 (high historical flats, but recent active; reference has appropriate low-vol periods).
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference captures dynamics.
- Hints: No high changepoint/monotone/flatline triggers for major correction.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):**
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.1875 (moderate clipping risk), quality_quantization=0.34: Minor clipping if needed, but reference values (~8-12) within historical bounds (peaks ~20). No expansion/clipping applied.

**Event/Pattern (event_summary_tool & comprehensive):**
- dominant_pattern_name=""fall"" (event_dominant_pattern=1.0), but recent segment is rising (17:30 to 23:45: -0.3→12.3).
- Reference shows mild downward envelope with fluctuations, compatible with ""fall"" constraint (no strong upward bias). Maintain reference's subtle decline.

**Other Features (comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- median=0.2, but recent mean ~10+; reference aligns with recent regime.
- acf1=0.96 (persistent), spec_entropy=2.37 (some noise): Reference preserves autocorrelation/fluctuations.
- flatline_hits=0.1875, peak_count=2: Reference has realistic low/high periods.
- No bias/residual corrections needed (residual_mean~0).

**Final Decision:** Reference_prediction is optimal foundation. No major corrections triggered (no changepoint, quality issues minor, pattern compatible). Use reference values directly as they match wind power characteristics (cyclical, volatile, non-monotonic). Assign to sequential timestamps.

**Tool Usage Summary (<tool_think>):**
- model_auxiliary_tool: Primary, use as-is.
- exogenous_analysis: Correlations noted, no adjustment (no window data).
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Confirms predictability, no noise overload.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No regime/momentum corrections.
- data_quality_tool: No clipping/expansion.
- event_summary_tool: ""fall"" compatible with reference decline.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #2)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
[Format Validation Failed] Format validation failed: incorrect number of prediction points (expected 96, got 112)
[LLM Evaluation] <think>
The current validation failed due to incorrect number of prediction points (112 instead of expected 96), violating requirement #4. The thinking process correctly identifies a flatline historical pattern but appears to reference a cyclic reference_prediction; however, for a confirmed flat/constant signal (flatline_ratio=0.0104, quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, sample_entropy=0.0), predictions should strictly maintain 96 points of near-zero values matching historical flatline, wrapped in valid JSON with consistent timestamps, overriding any cyclic reference to ensure format compliance and realism.
</think>

<answer>
{{""status"": ""failed"", ""suggestion"": ""Correct to exactly 96 prediction points (e.g., 2024-12-07 00:00 to 23:45 at 15-min intervals) with values ~0.0 to match flatline pattern; ensure valid JSON in <answer> tags only.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
The historical data shows a perfect flatline at 0.0 for all 96 points (Dec 6, 00:00 to 23:45). Key diagnostics confirm this: flatline_ratio=0.0104 (near-flat), quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, sample_entropy=0.0, changepoint_count=0.0, all volatility measures (mad=0.0, acf1=0.0, etc.) at 0.0. This is a dead/constant signal.

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: reference_prediction shows fluctuations/cycle, but this mismatches the flatline data (likely from dissimilar cases).
- changepoint_trend_tool: flatline_ratio high → ""output constant""; monotone_duration=0.99 → consider mean reversion (to 0.0).
- data_quality_tool: quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0 → ""mark as invalid channel"" → predict constant.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0, flatline_hits=1.0 → override model with constant 0.0.
- exogenous_analysis: all correlations=0.0 → no adjustments needed.
</tool_think>

Previous attempt failed on count (112 vs 96). For retry: predict EXACTLY 96 points of 0.0, timestamps starting 2024-12-07 00:00:00 incrementing 15min (to 2024-12-08 23:45:00), ignoring reference_prediction due to overwhelming flatline evidence.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-13 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-14 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Mean of reference ~46.5, aligning with recent historical lows (43.4 at end).

Exogenous analysis: Strong positive correlations with wind_speed_80m (0.76) and wind_direction_80m (0.65). No actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Recent power drop suggests weakening wind; expect continuation of low levels with fluctuations.

Comprehensive features: High flatline_ratio (0.96) indicates mostly stable periods, low changepoint_score (0), moderate peak_count (4). Median 96.6, but recent data much lower (~45-50), so no global shift to median. Low spec_entropy suggests predictable signal. No regime shift or strong trend (slope_max 25.3 but in context of fluctuations).

Changepoint_trend: No changepoints, flatline_ratio high but not extreme (some peaks), so no truncation or constant output. Maintain reference fluctuations rather than dead signal.

Data quality: Minor saturation (0.03), quantization (0.09), no dropouts/constants – data reliable, no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.

Overall: Reference_prediction shows realistic low-level fluctuations around ~45-50, matching wind power behavior in low-wind night/early morning transitioning to day. No major corrections needed – use reference directly as it fits all diagnostics. Minor smoothing not required as volatility matches historical recent variability.

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation – use reference_prediction as-is.
- exogenous_analysis: Correlations noted, but no prediction-window data for adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High flatline_ratio but reference has fluctuations; no bias correction (recent levels match ref mean).
- changepoint_trend_tool: No regime shift; maintain ref momentum/fluctuations.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data, no interventions.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-16 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-12-17 00:00:00"" through ""2024-12-20 11:45:00"".

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They show gradual decline from ~30 to ~25, with small fluctuations, matching wind power diurnal patterns.

Exogenous analysis: wind_speed_80m (corr 0.314) and direct_radiation (0.249) are top correlates. No specific future exogenous values provided, so no direct adjustment. Maintain base as is.

Changepoint_trend_tool: changepoint_score=0 (no regime shift), slope_max=13.9 (past momentum, but base already incorporates), flatline_ratio=0.83 high but historical has fluctuations (acf1=0.88), peak_count=4. No truncation/boost needed; base handles.

Comprehensive_feature_tool: median=27.4 (base starts ~30, declines to ~25, reasonable), mad=6.55 (base volatility matches), spec_entropy=0.4 (moderate predictability), flatline_ratio high but not dead signal. No major corrections.

Data_quality_tool: Minor saturation (0.04), no dropouts/constants. No clipping/amplification.

Overall: Base prediction is optimal foundation. No significant deviations needed. Use reference values directly, rounded to 1 decimal for consistency with input data.

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Direct use of reference_prediction (96 values).
- exogenous_analysis: Correlations noted but no future values for adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Confirms base aligns with median/mad/volatility.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints, high flatline but base has fluctuations.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data, no quality gates triggered.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-15 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-12-16 00:00:00"" through approximately ""2024-12-18 23:45:00"".

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 96 values, around 42-54 range, showing fluctuations consistent with wind power volatility).

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlations with wind_direction_80m (0.72) and wind_speed_80m (0.51). No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor refinement: since recent data shows declining power (ending ~28.5) and dominant pattern is fall, slightly bias reference downward by averaging with recent historical mean (~50 aligns well, no major shift needed).

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool)**: No changepoints (score=0). High flatline_ratio (0.9375) but low hits (0.02), slope_max=33.3 (recent uptrend momentum faded), slope_second_diff_max=29.1 (deceleration). Recent fall dominant, so maintain mild downward bias but keep reference fluctuations (no truncation/boost/reversion needed).

**Event Summary**: dominant_pattern_name=""fall"" (event_dominant_pattern=1.0). Constrain to downward-leaning trend: reference already ~50s (down from historical peak ~160), matches fall continuation with oscillation.

**Data Quality**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.02 low), no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Comprehensive Features**: Median=76.2, but recent values ~30s, reference ~50s reasonable transition. High acf1=0.966 (persistent), spec_entropy=0.76 (some noise) → follow reference fluctuations conservatively. No major bias correction (reference mean ~50 aligns with fall regime).

**Final Strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it captures patterns/volatility from similar cases. Minor fall-constraint adjustment: subtract 0.5-1.0 from later points for downward lean (total shift <2% to preserve fluctuations). Output assigns to correct timestamps.

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation → use reference_prediction as base.
- exogenous_analysis: Wind vars key but no future data → no adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Recent fall regime, reference fits.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No regime shift, flatline minor → no truncation.
- data_quality_tool: Clean data → no clipping.
- event_summary_tool: ""fall"" → ensure mild downward trend (reference complies).

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-11-30 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-01 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They show gradual increase from ~3.5 to ~5.2 with fluctuations, capturing volatility and patterns from similar cases. Mean ~4.5, volatility consistent.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlations with wind_direction_80m (0.79) and wind_speed_80m (0.58). Historical data shows power dropping to 0 during low wind/calm conditions (late morning to midnight). Reference prediction assumes gradual wind recovery into Dec 1, which aligns with wind power recovery post-calm. No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor uplift (+0.1-0.2) to base for expected wind improvement, but keep close to reference.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):** 
- changepoint_score=0 (no structural breaks).
- flatline_ratio=0.4375, run_length_longest=38 (recent long flat at 0).
- slope_max=14.7 early uptrend, but dominant recent is flat/decline to 0.
- sample_entropy very low (predictable, low noise).
- No truncation/boost needed; reference already transitions smoothly from flat.

**Event Summary:** dominant_pattern_name=""fall"" (event_dominant_pattern=1.0), with 4 fall events. Recent history ends in prolonged fall to flat 0. Reference shows mild rise (consistent with wind recovery post-fall), so maintain gradual upward with fluctuations, no strong downward force.

**Data Quality:** quality_saturation_ratio=0.0625 (minor clipping early), quantization=0.43 (ok). No clipping or uncertainty expansion needed; predictions within historical bounds (0-37).

**Comprehensive Features:** median=0, mad=0.45 (low vol recent), acf1=0.92 (persistent), flatline_hits=0.0625. Reference matches low-recent-vol transitioning to moderate fluctuations ~4-5.

**Final Strategy:** 
- Foundation: reference_prediction (closely follow pattern/volatility).
- Adjustments: Minor +0.05 average uplift for wind correlation/extrapolation from early morning peaks in history. No major deviations (maintain fluctuations, no mono-trend).
- Ensure exactly 96 floats, realistic wind power (non-negative, gradual ramp-up).

Computed timestamps and predictions:
- Start: ""2024-12-01 00:00:00""
- Predictions: reference + small noise/ uplift for refinement (e.g., avg(reference) ~4.5 → ~4.55).
</think>

<tool_think>
Used all tools:
- model_auxiliary_tool: base = reference_prediction
- exogenous_analysis: minor uplift for wind correlations
- comprehensive_feature_tool: low entropy/flat recent → smooth transition
- changepoint_trend_tool: no changepoints, moderate slope → follow reference rise
- data_quality_tool: good quality, no clipping
- event_summary_tool: ""fall"" dominant but recent flat → allow gradual recovery
</tool_think>

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-17 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-18 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 96 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar cases.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlations with temperature_2m (0.85) and wind_speed_80m (0.84). No exogenous time series data provided for prediction window, so cannot apply specific adjustments. Rely on base prediction which likely incorporates these dynamics.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool)**:
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shifts, use full history.
- slope_max=12.1, slope_second_diff_max=12.8: Recent momentum captured in base.
- flatline_ratio=0.927 high but flatline_hits=0.021 low: Some flat periods but not dominant; base prediction shows fluctuations (e.g., 31-37 range early, rising to 36-37 later).
- peak_count=2, monotone_duration=0.21: Historical diurnal pattern; base maintains realistic volatility.
- No major corrections needed (no high changepoint, no extreme monotone for reversion, no dead signal).

**Data Quality**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.021 low, no clipping needed. Other quality metrics fine.

**Cross-channel**: corr_flip_count=3 moderate, lead_lag_shift_mean=8.5 but no auxiliary series provided; minimal adjustment.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=37.75, base prediction averages ~34-35 (slightly low, minor upward bias possible but base is primary).
- acf1=0.97 high persistence, spec_entropy=0.64 moderate noise: Base prediction preserves autocorrelation and fluctuations.
- No injections/expansions needed.

**Final Strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches requirements (volatility, fluctuations). Minor smoothing not needed as it already shows realistic wind power diurnal-like pattern (low night, potential day rise). No tool-based overrides trigger significant changes.

<tool_think>
All tools considered: Base is foundation, no strong corrections from changepoint/quality/cross-channel/exogenous (no prediction-window exog data).

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-18 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-12-19 00:00:00"" through approximately ""2024-12-21 23:45:00"".

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the foundation. They show mild fluctuations around 5-8, capturing realistic wind power volatility (no monotonic trend).

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.80) and relative_humidity_2m (0.68). No specific future exogenous values provided, so no direct adjustment. Recent data ends with increasing power (4.2, 5.1, 4.1, 7.7), aligning with reference starting ~5-6.

**Changepoint/Trend (changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive):** No changepoints (score=0). High flatline_ratio (0.65) indicates much zero/low power history, but recent uptick and 4 peaks suggest intermittent activity. slope_max=19.1 (uptrend momentum), but monotone_duration low (0.1). No truncation/boost needed; reference already handles.

**Data Quality:** saturation_ratio=0.156 (minor clipping risk), quantization=0.48 (ok). No clipping or uncertainty expansion required.

**Comprehensive Features:** Median=1.4 (reference mean ~6.5 higher, but recent values align better). High acf1=0.91 (persistent), low sample_entropy=0.13 (predictable). flatline_ratio high but event_count=8 (activity). No major bias correction; reference suitable.

**Final Strategy:** Use reference_prediction directly as it matches instructions (foundation from similar cases, preserves fluctuations). Minor uplift (+0.2) on last 10 points to reflect recent momentum (7.7 end), but keep close to avoid deviation. Maintain volatility/pattern.

<tool_think>
- Reference: Primary guide, fluctuations 5-8 range preserved.
- Exog: Wind_speed key but no future data → no adjust.
- Changepoint: No regime shift.
- Quality: Minor saturation → no clip.
- Features: Persistence high → reference fits.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-19 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-20 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes each.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Mean of reference ~34.3, which aligns reasonably with historical median (44.05) but is lower, suggesting a continuation of the evening decline into night.

Exogenous correlations (exogenous_analysis): Strongest is relative_humidity_2m (-0.536, inverse), temperature_2m (0.416, positive). No specific future exogenous values provided, so no direct numerical adjustment. Generally supports nighttime decline (higher RH, lower temp → lower wind power).

Changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints (score=0), but high flatline_ratio (0.9375) indicates data has many flat periods, though recent data shows dynamics. slope_max=40.1 (uptrend momentum earlier), slope_second_diff_max=28.1 (acceleration), peak_count=4. No truncation needed; maintain reference fluctuations rather than smooth.

Comprehensive_feature_tool: High acf1 (0.935) indicates strong autocorrelation – reference should preserve this. spec_entropy=1.15 (some noise), so conservative adjustments. flatline_ratio high but not dead signal. No major bias correction needed (residual_mean~0).

Data_quality_tool: Minor saturation (0.031), no dropouts/constants – data reliable, no clipping/expansion required.

Overall: Reference prediction shows mild decline from ~31-33 early, rise to ~39 mid-day, then decline to ~29-30. Matches wind power diurnal cycle (night low, day peak). No strong reasons to deviate significantly – minor downward bias for night continuation, but preserve volatility/pattern.

Final prediction: Use reference values directly (floats as-is), ensuring exactly 96 points.
<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation – use reference_prediction directly.
- exogenous_analysis: Nighttime conditions support reference decline; no future values for adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High flatline_ratio but dynamic recent trend; acf1 high → preserve reference autocorrelation.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No regime shift; momentum captured in reference.
- data_quality_tool: Reliable data, no interventions.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-22 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-23 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

**Base Foundation (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the reference_prediction array of 96 values as the primary baseline. It captures temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Mean of ref pred ≈ -1.03, aligns with historical median -0.9.

**Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis):** Strong positive corr with direct_radiation (0.54), negative with relative_humidity_2m (-0.31). No actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment not applied. Focus on base.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.02 low, quantization=0.5 ok). No clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.

**Regime & Momentum (changepoint_trend_tool):** No changepoints (score=0). slope_max=1.0, slope_second_diff_max=1.3 indicate past momentum but not extreme. flatline_ratio=0.15 moderate, no dead signal. monotone_duration=0.33 not extreme, no strong mean reversion. No truncation/boost/reversal corrections.

**Pattern Constraint (event_summary_tool):** dominant_pattern_name=""rise"" (event_counts [6 rise, 2 fall]). Maintain general upward tendency where ref pred allows, but ref pred shows fluctuations around -1, not strict mono rise.

**Comprehensive (comprehensive_feature_tool):** Confirms median=-0.9, mad=0.05 (low vol), acf1=0.87 (persistent), spec_entropy=1.12 (some noise). flatline_ratio=0.15, peak_count=4. No major bias (residual_mean≈0). Use conservative strategy: stick closely to ref pred pattern/volatility.

**Final Decision:** Ref pred is reliable foundation. No major corrections needed (low changepoint/quality issues). Slight shift up by ~0.07 to align mean closer to historical median (-0.9 vs ref -1.03) for minor bias correction, preserving exact pattern/fluctuations/volatility. Maintain fluctuations (no mono trend). Output rounded to 1 decimal for consistency with input style, but as floats.

Adjusted values: ref_pred[i] + 0.07 (small shift for level alignment).

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #2)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The previous response failed format validation due to only 91 prediction points instead of the required 96. To pass, the new response must include exactly 96 time points starting from ""2024-12-22 00:00:00"" at 15-minute intervals, using valid JSON in <answer></answer> tags with the reference_prediction values (11-16 range with upward trend) as the foundation, while ensuring timestamp consistency.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-21 23:45:00"". Next timestamps start at ""2024-12-22 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes for exactly 96 points (covers 24 hours).

Previous attempt failed due to incomplete list (91 points) and wrong format (array of objects instead of flat key-value pairs). This time, ensure exactly 96 key-value pairs in valid JSON object.

Base prediction: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool (96 values, range ~11-16) as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. It captures temporal patterns/volatility from similar cases - must follow closely.

Key refinements:
- exogenous_analysis: Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.935), negative with temperature_2m (-0.447). Reference already incorporates these via similar cases; minor upward adjustment in mid-period where wind likely picks up.
- comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool: High flatline_ratio (0.875) and run_length_longest (18), low changepoint_score (0). Indicates persistent low periods; reference handles this. slope_max (16.5) suggests momentum - slight boost to reference in rising segments.
- ar_residual_tool: residual_mean ~0 (no bias correction needed). residual_acf1 (0.27) moderate - preserve reference fluctuations.
- data_quality_tool: saturation_ratio 0.167 - clip if needed, but reference within historical bounds (0-97).
- cross_channel_tool: lead_lag_shift_mean 17 - minor lag adjustment not critical.

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction values directly (round to 2 decimals for floats), ensuring pattern/volatility preserved (fluctuations around 12-15, upward trend overall). No major deviations.

<tool_think>
Reference values used as-is: mean~14.0, std~1.1, matches wind power low-wind regime. Adjustments minimal: +0.01 to +0.05 in positions 50-70 for wind momentum (slope_max hint), but kept negligible to stay true to foundation.

Verify: 96 timestamps from ""2024-12-22 00:00:00"" to ""2024-12-23 23:45:00"".

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #9)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
[Format Validation Failed] Format validation failed: incorrect number of prediction points (expected 96, got 100)
[LLM Evaluation] <think>
Previous response failed format validation due to 100 prediction points instead of required 96. Historical data is flat at 0.0 (quality_saturation_ratio=1.0, constant_channel_ratio=1.0), mandating clipped constant output of 96 zeros matching historical bounds and flat pattern. Modification needed: truncate to exactly 96 points, ensure valid JSON with consistent timestamp format.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
The historical data is completely flat at 0.0 for all 96 points. Key tool insights override the reference_prediction:

- comprehensive_feature_tool: quality_saturation_ratio=1.0, quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0 → clip predictions to historical bounds (0.0).
- data_quality_tool: quality_saturation_ratio=1.0, quality_constant_channel_ratio=1.0 → clip to saturation bounds (0.0), mark constant channel as invalid for deviation.
- changepoint_trend_tool: flatline_ratio near 1, monotone_duration=0.99 → dead/flat signal, output constant.
- event_summary_tool: dominant_pattern_name=""flat"" → constrain prediction to flat around mean (0.0).
- exogenous_analysis: all correlations=0.0 → no exogenous adjustment needed.

Reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool shows fluctuations and negatives, but given perfect saturation/constant quality flags and flat dominant pattern, MUST clip all to 0.0 (historical bound/mean). Previous attempt failed format: not key-value timestamp pairs, wrong structure (array under ""predictions""). 

Last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-04 23:45:00"". Next 96: start ""2024-12-05 00:00:00"", increment by 15min (covers exactly 24h). Generate exactly 96 timestamp-value pairs, all values 0.0.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-24 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-25 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They show high sustained wind power output (~100-120+ MW) with realistic fluctuations, volatility, and no monotonic trend, matching wind power characteristics.

Exogenous analysis:
- Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.864): Recent high output aligns with likely sustained strong winds.
- Negative correlation with direct_radiation (-0.346): Nighttime into Christmas Day morning suggests low radiation, supporting continued high wind generation.
- No adjustments needed as base already captures this; no exogenous time series provided for prediction window.

Changepoint_trend_tool:
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift; use full history.
- slope_max=21.4, slope_second_diff_max=16.9: Recent strong uptrend momentum captured in base.
- flatline_ratio=0.885 high historically, but recent data shows dynamic high output; no dead signal now.
- No truncation or reversion needed.

Data quality:
- quality_saturation_ratio=0.135: Minor clipping risk, but recent values hit 150+ MW without issue; no clipping required.
- No dropouts or constant issues.

Comprehensive features:
- High acf1=0.956: Strong autocorrelation preserved in base.
- qkurt=4.58: Fat tails/volatility matched in base fluctuations.
- event_segment_count=8: Multi-phase day captured.
- No major corrections; base aligns.

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction directly as it incorporates similar cases, maintains volatility/patterns, and aligns with all diagnostics. Minor rounding to 2 decimals for float consistency with input style, but values unchanged.
<tool_think>
All tools confirm base reliability: strong wind correlation sustains high output; no changepoints/quality issues; momentum from recent peak preserved in fluctuating high levels.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
<tool_think>
**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use reference_prediction as PRIMARY foundation. It shows values around 100-106 MW with natural fluctuations (not monotonic), which matches wind power volatility. This captures similar historical patterns - MUST follow closely.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong positive correlations with wind_speed_80m (0.89) and wind_direction_80m (0.69). No actual exogenous values provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Recent historical power (last few points: 146→138→122 MW) suggests sustained wind - reference_prediction (~100-105 MW average) is reasonable continuation.

**Comprehensive Features:** Median=64.8 (reference higher, but recent data ~120-170 suggests upward regime). High flatline_ratio=0.95 but low flatline_hits=0.04 indicates data reliability. High acf1=0.97 shows persistence - reference already models this. spec_entropy=0.85 moderate noise - conservative smoothing not needed.

**Changepoint/Trend:** No changepoints (score=0). High slope_max=48, slope_second_diff_max=64 indicate momentum, but dominant event='rise' - reference maintains mild upward bias initially then fluctuates. No truncation/boost needed; flatline_ratio high but not triggering constant output.

**Data Quality:** Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.04 minor) - no clipping/uncertainty expansion.

**Event Summary:** dominant_pattern_name='rise' (event_counts [4 rise, 3 fall]) - constrain to maintain mild upward tendency/fluctuations, which reference does.

**Overall Strategy:** 
- Foundation: reference_prediction (mean~102.5, std~2.0 - stable post-peak decline continuation).
- No major corrections: No changepoints, quality good, exogenous qualitative support.
- Minor bias correction: Historical recent mean ~130, reference ~102 - slight upward shift (+5-10) to align with 'rise' constraint and wind correlations, but keep volatility/pattern identical.
- Final: Use reference with small uniform +8 shift for regime alignment (recent levels), preserving all fluctuations.

**Timestamp Generation:** Last input ""2024-12-26 23:45:00"" → next ""2024-12-27 00:00:00"", +15min increments to 96 points (exactly 24hr).

**Final Prediction:** Adjusted reference (each value +8.0) for rise constraint/recent level alignment: maintains pattern/volatility.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-28 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps increment by 15 minutes, starting ""2024-12-29 00:00:00"" through approximately ""2024-12-31 15:45:00"".

**Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool):** Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases. Mean ~97.5, with fluctuations between ~91-104, maintaining realistic wind power variability.

**Exogenous Analysis:** Strong negative correlation with wind_direction_80m (-0.806), positive with wind_speed_80m (0.512). No actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no specific numerical adjustments. Note for general context: favorable direction/speed could sustain high output, but cannot quantify without data.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool, comprehensive_feature_tool):**
- changepoint_score=0, changepoint_count=0: No regime shifts, use full history.
- slope_max=26.7 (uptrend momentum), slope_second_diff_max=30: Recent acceleration supports sustaining high levels seen in evening peak (~160+), but no need for aggressive boost as reference already elevated.
- flatline_ratio=0.95 high, but recent data shows volatility (peaks 170+), so not ""dead signal"".
- peak_count=2, monotone_duration low: Expect continued fluctuations, matching reference.

**Data Quality (data_quality_tool):** quality_saturation_ratio=0.042 low, no clipping needed. quality_dropout_ratio=0, reliable.

**Comprehensive Features:** median=55.9 (historical), but recent values 100-170 indicate new high regime. Reference aligns with recent levels. acf1=0.97 high autocorrelation, spec_entropy=0.87 (some noise) - reference preserves this. No major bias correction needed (residual_mean~0).

**Final Strategy:** Adopt reference_prediction directly as it matches instructions (foundation, patterns, volatility). Minor refinement: slight upward tilt (+0.1 average) in second half to reflect slope_max momentum and evening peak persistence, without deviating from fluctuations. Ensures exactly 96 points, realistic wind variability (no monotone).

<tool_think>
- Base: reference_prediction (primary, use as-is with pattern preservation).
- Exogenous: Correlations noted, no adjustment data.
- Changepoint/Trend: No truncation/boost needed; sustain high regime.
- Quality: Clean data.
- Comprehensive: Aligns with recent elevated levels.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #6)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response contains a complete <think> tag but is truncated/incomplete—it lacks the required <answer> tag with valid JSON containing exactly 96 time points, causing the format validation failure. To pass validation, the response must include a full <answer> tag with properly formatted JSON (e.g., {{""predictions"": [{{""timestamp"": ""2024-12-13 00:00:00"", ""value"": 93.3}}, ...]}} for 96 points matching the timestamp sequence from ""2024-12-13 00:00:00"" to ""2024-12-13 23:45:00""). Prediction logic in <think> is reasonable (smooth transition from 113.9, wind-correlated volatility), but format must be fixed for quality approval.
</think>

<answer>
{{""status"": ""FAILED"", ""suggestions"": ""Complete the response by adding a full <answer> tag with valid JSON containing exactly 96 prediction points (array of timestamp-value pairs) using the reference_prediction values adjusted for smooth transition; ensure timestamps are 15-min intervals from '2024-12-13 00:00:00' to '2024-12-13 23:45:00'.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-12 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-13 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes up to ""2024-12-13 23:45:00"" (exactly 96 points: 4 per hour * 24 hours).

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 96 values provided, starting from 93.31 smoothing from last historical 113.9 with gradual decline then fluctuations around ~80, matching wind power volatility).

**Exogenous Refinement**: Strong positive correlations with wind_speed_80m (0.77) and wind_direction_80m (0.54). No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor adjustment not needed; reference already incorporates similar historical wind patterns.

**Changepoint/Trend Analysis** (<tool_think>Changepoint score=0 (no regime shift), slope_max=39.6 (recent uptrend momentum from 113.9), slope_second_diff_max=25.6 (deceleration starting), dominant_pattern=""rise"" (event_counts [6 rises,2 falls]), flatline_ratio=0.97 but recent volatility high. Action: Slight initial boost from 113.9 then follow reference decline for mean reversion, maintain rise-dominant fluctuations without strong downtrend.</tool_think>)

**Quality/Event**: Low quality issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.09 minor clipping risk at ~100 max historical), event dominant ""rise"" → constrain to fluctuating upward bias around reference mean ~81.

**Final Prediction Strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it captures smooth transition, wind-correlated volatility (high acf1=0.91 continuity), and 96-point fluctuations. No major corrections needed (no changepoint, low residuals); minor +0.5 shift for momentum from 113.9 and rise dominance, but keep volatility/pattern identical to pass validation.

Output format: JSON object with timestamp keys and float values (exactly 96).

expert. Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #5)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided ""Response to Review"" fails format validation as it lacks <answer></answer> tags with valid JSON containing exactly 96 time points (only references reference_prediction without delivering formatted output). To pass, the response must include <think> (already present), followed by <answer> with a JSON object like {{""predictions"": [{{""timestamp"": ""2024-12-24 00:00:00"", ""value"": X}}, ...]}} for 96 points starting from ""2024-12-24 00:00:00"" at 15-min intervals, using the 96 reference_prediction values as the foundation with minor refinements based on tool insights for wind decline continuation.
</think>

<answer>
{{""status"": ""failed"", ""suggestion"": ""Include <answer> tags with valid JSON containing exactly 96 prediction points in timestamp-value pairs starting from '2024-12-24 00:00:00', using reference_prediction values refined for post-peak wind decline.""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-23 23:45:00"". Next timestamps start at ""2024-12-24 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes for 96 points.

The historical data shows mostly negative values (low/no generation) until a sharp rise at the end: 22:30=-0.7, 22:45=1.0, 23:00=3.0, 23:15=3.2 (peak), 23:30=2.6, 23:45=0.5. This indicates a wind event starting late on 12-23.

model_auxiliary_tool provides reference_prediction with 96 values: starts around 1.1-1.5 (post-peak decline continuation), peaks mid-way ~1.6-1.8, then declines to negative values around hours 50-60, recovers slightly to ~0.4 at end. This captures realistic wind power fluctuations: initial decline from recent peak, morning ramp-up, daytime peak, evening decline.

Key refinements:
- exogenous_analysis: Positive correlations with direct_radiation (0.31) and wind_speed_80m (0.23). Reference already incorporates these via similar cases; no specific exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so minor boost to early morning values (low radiation expected overnight/early) but maintain pattern.
- event_summary_tool: dominant_pattern_name=""rise"" (event_counts [3 rises, 2 falls]), so maintain overall upward momentum where reference shows it, but respect fluctuations.
- changepoint_trend_tool: slope_max=2.1, slope_second_diff_max=1.8 indicate recent acceleration (matches late rise); peak_count=3, so expect continued peaks/fluctuations. No high changepoint_score (0.0), so use full history. flatline_ratio=0.17 moderate, no constant output needed.
- comprehensive_feature_tool/data_quality_tool: quality_saturation_ratio=0.031 low, no clipping; median=-0.9 but recent shift to positive, reference handles regime change.
- Overall: Use reference_prediction as foundation (closely follow pattern/volatility). Minor refinements: slight upward adjustment (~+0.05) to first 24 points for continued post-peak momentum (recent slope_max high, dominant rise); dampen deep negatives mid-sequence slightly (-0.02 shift) for wind persistence; ensure 15-min volatility preserved.

Final prediction uses reference values with these tiny refinements to address feedback on ""post-peak wind decline continuation"" while matching tool insights. JSON will have exactly 96 timestamp:float pairs.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #8)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
Current validation failed due to incorrect number of prediction points (112 instead of 96). To pass, generate exactly 96 time points starting from ""2024-12-11 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes each (ending at ""2024-12-12 23:45:00""), with realistic wind power predictions around mean 6.8MW, diurnal peaks ~8.5MW midday, fluctuations ±0.3-0.5MW, in valid JSON array of timestamp-value objects. Previous response had format issues (array of objects with extra points); ensure strict JSON compliance with precisely 96 entries matching reference structure.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-10 23:45:00"". Next timestamps start at ""2024-12-11 00:00:00"" and increment by 15 minutes for exactly 96 points, ending at ""2024-12-11 23:45:00"" (confirmed: 4 points/hour * 24 hours = 96).

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool provides exactly 96 values (mean ~6.8MW, diurnal peak ~8.5MW midday, fluctuations ±0.3-0.5MW), matching requirements. Use as PRIMARY foundation without significant deviation to preserve patterns/volatility.

Refinements:
- exogenous_analysis: Strong positive correlations with temperature_2m (0.75) and wind_speed_80m (0.65). Reference already incorporates these (from similar cases), so minor adjustments only: slight boost midday (temp/wind peaks), no exogenous time series provided for exact scaling.
- comprehensive_feature_tool/changepoint_trend_tool: High flatline_ratio (0.64), but recent history shows peaks (e.g., 33MW); slope_max=9.1 indicates momentum captured in reference. No changepoints (score=0), so no truncation. Low sample_entropy suggests predictable; follow reference.
- data_quality_tool: Minor saturation (0.16), quantization (0.31); clip if needed but reference within historical bounds (0-33MW).

No major corrections needed; reference realistic for wind power. Previous attempt failed on count (112) and format (array); output strict JSON object with 96 keys (timestamps) mapping to values (floors of reference for float precision, minor noise ±0.05MW for natural fluctuation while staying close).

Verify: 96 points, JSON object (not array), timestamps exact, values ~6.8 mean.

### data_quality_tool
- Description: Risk control tool (QUALITY GATE): Assesses data quality and reliability. This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal. Use for: (1) Uncertainty Amplification - if dropout_ratio is high, expand confidence interval; (2) Clipping - if saturation_ratio is high, clip predictions to historical bounds; (3) Invalid Channel - if constant_channel_ratio is high, mark channels as invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-30 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-31-01 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes, spanning into 2025-01-01.

**Base Prediction**: Use model_auxiliary_tool's reference_prediction (96 values) as PRIMARY FOUNDATION. Mean ~45.5, stable around 43-50 with fluctuations – this captures similar historical patterns for wind power.

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong correlations: wind_speed_80m (0.91), relative_humidity_2m (-0.79). No exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so cannot apply specific adjustments. Rely on base.

**Changepoint & Trend (changepoint_trend_tool + comprehensive_feature_tool)**:
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift, use full history.
- flatline_ratio=0.927 high: Significant flat periods historically, but recent end shows volatility (e.g., drop to 0.6 then up to 26.4). Reference already accounts for this.
- slope_max=32.1, slope_second_diff_max=23.4: Past momentum, but no current uptrend to boost.
- peak_count=2, sample_entropy=0.43: Low complexity, reference's mild fluctuations appropriate.
- No truncation/boost/reversion needed; reference fits.

**Data Quality**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.073 low, no clipping. quality_quantization_score=0.094 minor, no major issues.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=127.1 (higher than ref ~45), but recent data drops sharply (last:26.4), so reference likely adjusted for downturn.
- acf1=0.98 high persistence, flatline_ratio high: Reference's stable level with fluctuations matches.
- No bias correction needed as reference from similar cases.

**Final Strategy**: Closely follow reference_prediction (maintain its pattern/volatility). Minor smoothing for wind-like smoothness given high flatline_ratio historically, but preserve fluctuations. No major deviations.

<tool_think>
Used model_auxiliary_tool as base (primary). Incorporated exogenous correlations (no adjustment data). Applied changepoint_trend_tool (no shifts, high flatline supports stable ref). Data_quality_tool (clean). Comprehensive_feature_tool (historical median high but recent low aligns with ref level).

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-09 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-10 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation, as they capture optimal patterns from similar cases. They show mild fluctuations around ~2-3, gradually declining towards the end, which aligns with wind power's typical diurnal patterns post-peak.

Tool analysis for refinements:

<tool_think>
**model_auxiliary_tool**: Reference prediction is the core baseline. Mean ~2.8, maintains realistic volatility for wind (small ups/downs, no extremes). Follow closely.

**exogenous_analysis**: Strong correlations: relative_humidity_2m (-0.61), temperature_2m (0.57), wind_speed_80m (0.54). No actual exogenous series provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment: since historical end is low (~0.6) and nighttime into morning, expect continued low-moderate levels. No major shift; keep base intact.

**comprehensive_feature_tool**: Median 1.35 (base mean ~2.8 slightly higher → minor downward bias correction of ~0.1-0.2). High flatline_ratio (0.67) suggests periods of stability, but peak_count=3 and slope_max=10.6 indicate intermittent wind events – base already captures this. acf1=0.91 high persistence, spec_entropy=2.56 noisy → conservative, stick to base fluctuations. No changepoints.

**changepoint_trend_tool**: No changepoints (score=0). High flatline_ratio but not extreme; slope_max=10.6 (past uptrend), but current end low → no momentum boost needed. peak_spacing_cv low (regular) → base timing ok. No regime shift or reversion.

**data_quality_tool**: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.05 minor → no clipping, slight uncertainty but base volatility fine).
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches wind characteristics (fluctuations, no mono-trend). Minor bias correction: subtract 0.15 across all for median alignment (1.35 vs ~2.8 mean diff). Maintain exact 96 points, same volatility/pattern.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-29 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-30 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They show a gradual downward trend from ~100 to ~85 with small fluctuations, capturing typical wind power volatility.

Exogenous analysis:
- Strongest correlations: wind_direction_80m (-0.53), wind_speed_80m (0.44).
- No specific future exogenous values provided, so minor refinement only. Since base model likely incorporates similar patterns, no major adjustment needed.

Comprehensive features:
- High flatline_ratio (0.97) but low flatline_hits (0.05), indicating some stability but with events.
- High acf1 (0.86) shows persistence, which base prediction respects.
- slope_max (112) and slope_second_diff_max (114.7) indicate past momentum, but changepoint_score=0, no regime shift.
- No quality issues requiring clipping or uncertainty expansion (dropout=0, saturation low).

Changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints, high past slopes but current data ending at 114.7 suggests stabilization. Base prediction's gradual decline aligns with mean reversion post-peak.

Data quality: Clean data, no corrections needed.

Final strategy: Use reference_prediction directly as it matches wind power characteristics (fluctuations around 90-100, slow decline). No significant deviations needed per tools.

<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation - use reference_prediction as-is.
- exogenous_analysis: Correlations noted but no future values; base covers.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High persistence (acf1), moderate entropy; base fits.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No shifts, past momentum fading; base decline appropriate.
- data_quality_tool: High quality, no clipping.

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-27 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-28 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

**Base Prediction**: Use reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool as PRIMARY FOUNDATION (exactly 96 values provided). This captures optimal patterns from similar cases. Mean ~78.5, showing gradual decline with small fluctuations - matches wind power night/low-wind regime after evening drop in historical data (ending ~63).

**Exogenous Analysis**: Strong positive correlations with wind_direction_80m (0.735) and wind_speed_80m (0.632). Historical drop from ~175 to ~63 aligns with likely wind decrease/shift. Reference already incorporates this via similar cases; no exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so minor adjustment: slightly dampen early values if assuming continued low wind overnight.

**Changepoint/Trend (changepoint_trend_tool & comprehensive)**: 
- changepoint_count/score = 0: No regime shift; use full history.
- slope_max=33.4, slope_second_diff_max=43.2: Recent momentum was upward earlier, but now decelerating post-peak; reference correctly predicts continuation of decline/reversal.
- flatline_ratio=0.97 high but hits=0.02 low: Mostly stable periods, but 5 peaks; reference maintains low volatility fluctuations - preserve.
- peak_spacing_cv=0.3: Irregular; no need for periodic injection.
- monotone_duration low: No mean reversion needed.

**Data Quality**: quality_saturation_ratio=0.02 low (minor clipping risk), quantization=0.14 (some discretization), dropout=0: Reliable; no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed. Clip predictions to historical min/max (~59-186) - reference already within.

**Comprehensive Features**:
- median=145.4, but recent values ~60-80: Reference correctly shifts to lower regime.
- mad=21.15: Reference volatility ~1-5 matches low recent vol.
- acf1=0.89 high (persistent), spec_entropy=0.22 low (predictable): Reference smooth decline good.
- sample_entropy=0.85: Some complexity; keep reference fluctuations.
- No bias/residual correction needed (residual_mean~0).

**Final Strategy**: Use reference_prediction directly as it aligns with all diagnostics. Minor refinement: No exogenous series, but given correlations and historical night drop, accept gradual decline to ~70. Preserve exact 96 fluctuations/vol for realism. No major boosts/reversions.

**Tool Summary in <tool_think>**:
<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Base = reference_prediction (declining ~82→70 w/ fluctuations).
- exogenous_analysis: Wind vars key; reference likely tuned.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: Low entropy, high flatline → conservative smooth decline OK.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints, high flatline → follow reference pattern.
- data_quality_tool: Minor saturation → no clip.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last timestamp: ""2024-12-20 23:45:00"". Next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-21 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes.

Base prediction from model_auxiliary_tool: Use the 96 reference_prediction values as the primary foundation. They capture temporal patterns and volatility from similar cases.

Key exogenous insights (exogenous_analysis): Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.73), negative with relative_humidity_2m (-0.67). No actual exogenous time series provided for prediction window, so no quantitative adjustment possible. Reference already incorporates typical patterns.

Data characteristics (comprehensive_feature_tool, changepoint_trend_tool, data_quality_tool):
- High flatline_ratio (0.98) and flatline_hits (0.04), but also peak_count=3, slope_max=27, indicating periods of stability interrupted by peaks.
- No changepoints (score=0), so no regime truncation needed.
- slope_max=27 and slope_second_diff_max=26 suggest momentum, but since we're in evening decline (historical data ends dropping from 162 to 77), reference_prediction appropriately shows gradual decline.
- Low quality_saturation_ratio (0.04), minor quantization (0.10) – no major clipping or uncertainty expansion needed.
- High acf1 (0.94), moderate spec_entropy (0.32) – predictable with some noise; reference handles this.
- Median=125.15; reference starts around 72-80 (reasonable post-midnight continuation of night decline).

No major corrections needed: changepoint_score=0 (no truncation), no extreme monotone_duration/flatline requiring reversion/constant, quality issues minor. Reference_prediction shows realistic gradual decline with minor fluctuations matching wind power diurnal cycle (low overnight).

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction values directly as floats, paired with correct timestamps. Maintains required volatility/patterns.
<tool_think>
- model_auxiliary_tool: Foundation – use reference_prediction as-is.
- exogenous_analysis: Correlations noted (wind_speed primary driver), but no prediction-window data for adjustment.
- comprehensive_feature_tool: High flatline_ratio but peaks present; median 125 but current regime low – reference appropriate.
- changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints, momentum captured in reference decline.
- data_quality_tool: Minor issues, no clipping/amplification.

Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #7)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response fails format validation because it lacks properly formatted <answer></answer> tags containing valid JSON with exactly 96 time points. It includes a partial <think> section with tool analysis but no complete JSON output matching the timestamp format (e.g., starting ""2024-12-26 00:00:00"" incrementing by 15 minutes). To pass, complete the response with a full <think> detailing the 96 timestamps and values (using the ~60-75 MW range with low volatility as noted), followed by <answer> containing strict JSON like {{""predictions"": [{{""timestamp"": ""2024-12-26 00:00:00"", ""value"": 67.2}}, ...]}} for all 96 points.
</think>

<answer>
{{""status"": ""FAILED"", ""reason"": ""Missing <answer> JSON with 96 time points; incomplete response structure""}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

## Input Data

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-25 23:45:00"". The next 96 timestamps start from ""2024-12-26 00:00:00"" and increment by 15 minutes each (e.g., 00:15:00, 00:30:00, etc., rolling over days and hours appropriately).

The primary foundation is the model_auxiliary_tool's reference_prediction array with exactly 96 values (~60-75 MW range, low volatility, gradual downward trend with minor fluctuations, matching wind power night/low-wind scenario post-peak daytime generation).

Key analysis from tools:
<tool_think>
- **exogenous_analysis**: Strong positive correlation with wind_speed_80m (0.75), negative with relative_humidity_2m (-0.76). Historical data shows declining generation from evening peak to ~50MW at end, suggesting weakening winds/increasing humidity overnight. Reference prediction continues this mild decline realistically.
- **comprehensive_feature_tool & changepoint_trend_tool**: High flatline_ratio (0.9375), low changepoint_score (0), peak_count=1 (past daytime peak), slope_max=34 (past upward momentum now reversed). No regime shift; predict continuation of low-volatility decline/mean reversion around ~65MW median. Low spec_entropy (0.476) indicates predictable signal – follow reference closely.
- **data_quality_tool**: Minor saturation (0.042), no dropouts/constants – no clipping/uncertainty expansion needed.
</tool_think>

No major corrections needed: reference_prediction already captures low-volatility (~60-75MW), gradual decline matching correlations, post-peak regime, and historical end (~49MW transitioning smoothly). Minor bias correction: historical recent mean ~60MW aligns with reference start (~67-69). Maintain exact fluctuation pattern/volatility (std ~2-3MW).

Final prediction: Use reference_prediction values directly, paired with 96 timestamps in required JSON format (object with timestamp keys, float values).

forecasting expert. Your current task is to predict power generation in a wind power scenario.

## Task
Predict the next 96 time points based on the historical time series of 96 time points.
Timestamps increment by 15 minutes.
## Output Format Requirements
**CRITICAL:**
1. You MUST predict EXACTLY 96 time points (no more, no less)
2. Output format: JSON object with exactly 96 key-value pairs
3. Each key: timestamp string, each value: float number
4. Timestamps continue from the last input timestamp, incrementing by 15 minutes
5. Place your thinking in `<think></think>` tags
6. Place your prediction in `<answer></answer>` tags


## Previous Attempt Feedback (This is a retry, attempt #8)
The previous attempt had issues. Please carefully review the feedback below and ensure you address all problems:
<think>
The provided response to review contains properly formatted <think> tags with a clear reasoning process (timestamp calculation, 96-point sequence, pattern analysis, tool usage), but lacks <answer> tags with valid JSON containing exactly 96 time points—this directly causes the format validation failure. To pass validation, the response must be augmented with <answer> containing a JSON array or object with 96 prediction values (e.g., timestamps from ""2024-12-15 00:00:00"" to ""2024-12-18 23:45:00"" at 15-min intervals, values ~88-97 reflecting diurnal patterns), while preserving the existing <think> content.
</think>

<answer>
{{
  ""status"": ""FAILED"",
  ""suggestions"": ""Add <answer> tags immediately after <think> containing valid JSON with exactly 96 prediction values keyed by timestamps starting '2024-12-15 00:00:00' incrementing 15 minutes to '2024-12-18 23:45:00'; ensure values follow diurnal patterns (night ~88-92, day ~95-97) based on historical analysis.""
}}
</answer>

IMPORTANT: Make sure to fix the issues mentioned above, especially:
- Ensure you output EXACTLY 96 time points (not 144, not 192, not any other number)
- Verify the JSON format is correct
- Check that timestamps are consistent with the input format

### exogenous_analysis
- Description: Important adjustment tool (KEY REFINEMENT): Analyzes correlations between exogenous variables (e.g., weather, temperature) and the target variable. This provides CRITICAL adjustment criteria to refine the base prediction. Strongly consider these correlations when making final adjustments to the base forecast, and incorporate the actual time series of exogenous variables provided by the tool for the prediction window into your adjustments.

### changepoint_trend_tool
- Description: Critical correction tool (REGIME & MOMENTUM): Detects structural breaks and trend dynamics. This is the CORE tool for fixing model lag issues. Use for: (1) Memory Truncation - if changepoint_score is high, ignore pre-changepoint history; (2) Trend Boost - if slope_max is high in uptrend, apply linear compensation; (3) Peak Prediction - if slope_second_diff_max turns negative, predict reversal early; (4) Mean Reversion - if monotone_duration is extreme, consider reverting to mean; (5) Dead Signal Detection - if flatline_ratio is high, output constant or mark invalid.

## Instructions
**CRITICAL: How to use tool results (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Base Prediction (model_auxiliary_tool) - PRIMARY FOUNDATION:**
   - The reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool is your PRIMARY baseline and MUST be used as the foundation.
   - This reference_prediction already contains the correct temporal patterns and volatility from similar historical cases.
   - DO NOT ignore or significantly deviate from reference_prediction. Your final prediction should closely follow its pattern and volatility.
   - If reference_prediction shows fluctuations, your prediction MUST also show similar fluctuations.
2. **Key Refinement (exogenous_analysis) - IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT:**
   - Apply correlation insights from exogenous variables to refine the base prediction.
   - Use the actual exogenous variable values provided for the prediction window to make adjustments.
3. **Auxiliary Analysis (statistical_analysis, trend_analysis) - SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY:**
   - These tools are for understanding data characteristics ONLY, NOT for direct prediction.
   - **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT simply extrapolate based on trend_direction (e.g., 'increasing').
   - Time series often have fluctuations even when the overall trend is increasing or decreasing.
   - The reference_prediction already captures the correct pattern - use it as your primary guide.
4. **Advanced Feature Tools (LLM Correction Framework) - META-REASONING:**
   If any of the following tools are called, use their outputs for intelligent prediction correction:
   - **basic_statistics_tool**: Check `_llm_hints` for correction guidance.
     * If median differs significantly from model prediction mean, apply BIAS CORRECTION (shift prediction curve).
     * If mad is high, EXPAND confidence interval / uncertainty bounds.
     * If acf_s is high but reference_prediction is flat, INJECT periodic fluctuations.
     * If spec_entropy is high (noisy signal), use CONSERVATIVE strategy (e.g., moving average).
   - **changepoint_trend_tool**: This is the CORE correction tool for fixing model lag.
     * If changepoint_score is high, TRUNCATE memory - ignore pre-changepoint history, extrapolate from post-changepoint trend only.
     * If slope_max is high in uptrend, BOOST prediction values with linear compensation.
     * If slope_second_diff_max turns negative (decelerating), PREDICT REVERSAL early - lower the prediction curve.
     * If monotone_duration is extremely long, consider MEAN REVERSION.
     * If flatline_ratio is high, mark prediction as INVALID or output constant value.
   - **ar_residual_tool**: Use for residual-based correction.
     * If residual_mean != 0, ADD residual mean back to prediction.
     * If residual_acf1 is high, apply NONLINEAR correction using your reasoning.
   - **cross_channel_tool**: Use for multi-variate correction.
     * If lead_lag_shift_mean shows auxiliary variable leads by N steps, FORCE current variable to follow in next N steps.
     * If co_anom_ratio is high (macro event detected), apply GLOBAL directional adjustment.
   - **data_quality_tool**: This is the MOST IMPORTANT warning signal.
     * If quality_dropout_ratio is high, EXPAND confidence interval significantly.
     * If quality_saturation_ratio is high, CLIP predictions to historical saturation bounds.
   - **event_summary_tool**: Use for semantic constraint.
     * Check dominant_pattern_name and apply corresponding constraint:
       - 'rise': maintain upward trend
       - 'fall': maintain downward trend
       - 'flat': keep prediction oscillating around mean
       - 'oscillation': suppress unidirectional trends
   - **comprehensive_feature_tool**: Contains ALL features. Check `_llm_comprehensive_hints` for guidance.
**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
- Your prediction MUST maintain similar volatility and fluctuation patterns as the reference_prediction.
- Do NOT create a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence unless the reference_prediction shows such a pattern.
- If you use tool information, include it under `<tool_think></tool_think>` within `<think></think>`.
- Output ONLY one `<answer></answer>` JSON with exactly 96 points.","<think>
First, identify the last historical timestamp: ""2024-12-14 23:45:00"". Predictions start from the next 15-min increment: ""2024-12-15 00:00:00"", up to 96 points later, which is ""2024-12-17 23:45:00"" (4 days * 24 hours * 4 intervals/hour = 384 intervals, but historical is 96 points over ~1 day, prediction exactly 96 points: 96/4=24 hours, so 2024-12-15 00:00 to 2024-12-15 23:45).

Confirm: 96 intervals * 15 min = 1440 min = 24 hours exactly. Last hist: 2024-12-14 23:45 → first pred: 2024-12-15 00:00 → 96th: 2024-12-15 23:45.

Historical data shows diurnal wind pattern: low at night (~30-70), peaks midday/afternoon (~180), evening secondary peak (~170), then decline. Last points declining to 93.4.

Reference_prediction from model_auxiliary_tool (96 values) is primary foundation: starts ~93-94, diurnal-like (day peaks ~97, night ~88-92), volatility preserved (small fluctuations). Matches wind power scale post-peak decline.

Tool analysis:
<tool_think>
- exogenous_analysis: Strong positive corr wind_speed_80m (0.88), negative rel_humidity_2m (-0.86). No future exog values provided, so minor refinement: assume continuation of declining wind post-93.4, slight downward bias in night hours (88-92 range).
- comprehensive_feature_tool / changepoint_trend_tool: No changepoints (score=0), slope_max=40.2 (past uptrend momentum, but recent decline), flatline_ratio high (0.98? likely miscalc, data fluctuates), peak_count=3 (diurnal cycles). No truncation/boost needed; continue cycle.
- data_quality_tool: Low issues (dropout=0, saturation=0.03 minor), no clipping/amplification.
- Overall: Use reference_prediction as-is (closely follows hist volatility/pattern), minor adjustment: slight downward shift early night (~ -0.5 for wind decline), preserve fluctuations.
</tool_think>

Final prediction: Assign reference_prediction values directly to timestamps (no major deviation per instructions). Ensures exactly 96 points, correct format, pattern/volatility match.

Timestamp generation: Python-like loop confirmed 96 unique, sequential.
